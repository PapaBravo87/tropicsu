# Buffers, Buffer Action and Ocean Acidification

## Overview
> section: overview

This lesson plan introduces the topic of buffers and describes carbonate buffering in the ocean when atmospheric `CO_2` dissolves in seawater. The buffering capacity of the ocean is, however, limited, and therefore, higher concentrations of dissolved `CO_2` can lead to ocean acidification. Students will use a computer-based activity/model to explore how higher atmospheric `CO_2` levels (resulting in an increase in dissolved CO2) can lead to ocean acidification. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, or Earth Sciences.

## Buffer Solutions
> section: intro
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
* With the help of the reading, introduce the topic of buffers, explain buffer action and the maintenance of pH in a buffer solution.
* Explain the term buffer capacity, buffer range, and the pH equation of a given buffer. 
* Discuss other examples of buffers in daily life, e.g., the buffering action of blood.
:::


* In Chemistry, a buffer solution is a solution that resists the changes of its pH when an acid or base is added. 
* Following reading introduces the topic of buffers and explains the chemistry of buffer action in solution through examples.

::: column.grow
* The reading will be helpful to understand buffer action and the maintenance of pH in a buffer solution.
* Use examples (Examples 1 and 2) in the text “How Does A Buffer Maintain pH?” to calculate changes in the pH values when a weak acid or base is added to a buffer solution.

## Ocean Buffer Chemistry
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use this video micro-lecture explains carbonate buffering in the ocean. It also briefly discusses the change in the chemical composition of the ocean caused by a higher concentration of dissolved CO2, and the resulting effect on ocean biota.
* Further, use the video micro-lecture to illustrate Le Chatelier’s Principle—explain how increased `CO_2` concentration in seawater sequesters more carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions to keep the system in equilibrium.
* In conclusion, explain how ocean biota may be affected in the absence of freely available carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions.
:::

* Watch this micro-lecture about how oceans absorb atmospheric `CO_2` and the increase of acidity of sea water.
* Explore how high levels of atmospheric `CO_2` could result in an excess of free hydrogen (H+) ions, thus potentially changing the pH values of seawater (acidification).

::: column.grow
* Le Chatelier’s Principle states that, When any system at equilibrium for a long period of time is subjected to change in concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure, the system changes to a new equilibrium and this change partly counteracts the applied change.
* Explore how Le Chatelier’s Principle is applicable here — how increased `CO_2` concentration in seawater sequesters more carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions to keep the system in equilibrium. 
* Investigate how ocean biota may be affected in the absence of freely available carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions.

## Surface Ocean pH Levels
> section: applet
> format: Web applet
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
This visualization allows students to explore changes in the pH levels of oceans for different levels of atmospheric CO2, including the CO2 levels corresponding to various emission scenarios (as published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)).
:::

* This section presents an applet to make simulations of the pH value of the oceans.
* Open the applet "Surface Ocean pH Levels". Select the "Background" tab to read the background that provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and ocean pH values. Click on “Instructions” tab to read the instructions to run the applet.

- Run the simulation to visualize the global pH value (as indicated on the pH indicator strip) of oceans for a given concentration of atmospheric CO2. You can vary the atmospheric CO2 levels by using the slider at the bottom left hand side to observe the corresponding changes in the pH value of the oceans.
- Click the tab "Show Graph" to observe the graphs for concentrations of various species of carbonate ions in (i) a closed system and (ii) an open ocean; and the graph depicting the pH value of oceans for various atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
- Go to the tab "2100 C.E. Projections" to view the different emission scenarios (RCP Projections) that can be selected. Select different RCP projection options and visualize the corresponding predicted ocean pH value on the pH indicator strip or on the aforementioned graphs.

Note:  Detailed information about RCP projections is available in the same tab.

::: column.grow

* Finally, discuss the implications of the predicted pH value of oceans for different emission scenarios and the possible impacts on the Earth’s biosphere.
