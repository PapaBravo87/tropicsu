# Buffers, Buffer Action and Ocean Acidification

## Overview
> section: overview

This lesson plan introduces the topic of buffers and describes carbonate buffering in the ocean when atmospheric `CO_2` dissolves in seawater. The buffering capacity of the ocean is, however, limited, and therefore, higher concentrations of dissolved `CO_2` can lead to ocean acidification. Students will use a computer-based activity/model to explore how higher atmospheric `CO_2` levels (resulting in an increase in dissolved CO2) can lead to ocean acidification. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, or Earth Sciences.

## Buffer solutions
> section: intro
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Introduce the topic of buffers. Use the reading “Introduction to Buffers” to explain buffer action and the maintenance of pH in a buffer solution.

Explain the term buffer capacity, buffer range, and the pH equation of a given buffer. Use examples in the text “How Does A Buffer Maintain pH?” to calculate changes in the pH values when a weak acid or base is added to a buffer solution.

Discuss other examples of buffers in daily life, e.g., the buffering action of blood.
:::


In chemistry, a buffer solution is a solution that resists the changes of its pH when an acid or base is added. 

On this lesson we introduce the topic of buffers and describe carbonate buffering in the ocean when atmospheric `CO_2` dissolves in seawater. The buffering capacity of the ocean is, however, limited, and therefore, higher concentrations of dissolved `CO_2` can lead to ocean acidification. We will use a computer-based activity/model to explore how higher atmospheric `CO_2` levels (resulting in an increase in dissolved `CO_2`) can lead to ocean acidification.

## Ocean buffer chemistry
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use the video micro-lecture “Ocean Buffer Chemistry” to describe carbonate buffering in the ocean.

Discuss how oceans behave as carbon sinks by absorbing atmospheric `CO_2`, and the maintenance of ocean pH levels owing to the buffering capacity of sea water. Further, use the video to explain the buffering range of oceans and the chemical implications of a higher concentration of dissolved `CO_2` (due to increased levels of atmospheric `CO_2`).

Explain how high levels of atmospheric `CO_2` could result in an excess of free hydrogen (H+) ions, thus potentially changing the pH values of seawater (acidification).

Further, use the video micro-lecture to illustrate Le Chatelier’s Principle—explain how increased `CO_2` concentration in seawater sequesters more carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions to keep the system in equilibrium. In conclusion, explain how ocean biota may be affected in the absence of freely available carbonate (`CO_3^{2-}`) ions.

## Surface Ocean pH Levels
> section: applet
> format: Web applet
> duration: 60 min


On this section you will use an applet to make simulations of the pH value of the oceans.

Open the applet “Surface Ocean pH Levels”. Select the “Resources” tab to read the background that provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and ocean pH values. Click on “Help” to read the instructions to run the applet.

- Run the simulation to visualize the global pH value (as indicated on the pH indicator strip) of oceans for a given concentration of atmospheric CO2. You can vary the atmospheric CO2 levels by using the slider at the bottom left hand side to observe the corresponding changes in the pH value of the oceans.
- Click the tab “Show Graph” to observe the graphs for concentrations of various species of carbonate ions in (i) a closed system and (ii) an open ocean; and the graph depicting the pH value of oceans for various atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
- Go to the tab “Options” to view the different emission scenarios (Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) projections) that can be selected. Select different SRES projection options and visualize the corresponding predicted ocean pH value on the pH indicator strip or on the aforementioned graphs.

Note:  Detailed information about SRES projections can be obtained [here](http://ipcc-data.org/sim/gcm_clim/SRES_TAR/ddc_sres_emissions.html#a1b).


Finally, discuss the implications of the predicted pH value of oceans for different emission scenarios and the possible impacts on the Earth’s biosphere.
