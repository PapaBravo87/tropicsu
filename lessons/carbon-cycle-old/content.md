# Carbon Cycle

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Chemistry or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching topics in environmental chemistry such as the carbon cycle or biogeochemical cycles.
This lesson plan allows students to understand the carbon cycle, its components, and the flow among the different components of this biogeochemical cycle. The activity will introduce the link between the carbon cycle and climate. It will also explore how human activity (such as increased fossil fuel use) may affect the natural carbon cycle, and may thus cause climate-related changes.
Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.


__Grade Level__: High school, Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Chemistry    
__Topics__: Environmental Chemistry, Carbon Cycle, Biogeochemical Cycles  
__Climate Topic__: Long-term Cycles and Feedback Mechanisms    
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)  
__Duration__: 120-140 min  

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe the global carbon cycle and its components
* explain the flow among the components in the carbon cycle
* discuss the role of the carbon cycle in climate
* analyze and discuss the impact of human activities (such as the use of fossil fuels) on CO2 levels in the carbon cycle
* predict the possible effects of excess carbon in the system on the Earth’s climate

## Introduction to Global Carbon Cycle
> section: intro
> id: visualization
> format: visualization
> duration: 20 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use an interactive diagram that introduces the global carbon cycle, its components, and the flow among the various components through video clips and images.
:::

* Get introduced to the topic of the global carbon cycle by using the interactive diagram “Carbon Cycle”, from the Science Learning Hub (New Zealand).
* Observe the components of the carbon cycle and observe the flow among these parts. Interact with the components by clicking on them to learn more details.

## The Carbon Cycle and Earth’s Climate
> section: reading
> id: reading
> format: reading
> duration: 20-30 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading that provides an overview of the carbon cycle, and explains the link between the carbon cycle and the Earth’s climate.
:::

Use the reading “The Carbon Cycle and Earth’s Climate” from Columbia University to discuss details of the carbon cycle, some of the chemical reactions involved in the cycle, and the role of the carbon cycle in the Earth’s climate.

## 
> section: activity
> id: Activity
> format: activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a classroom/laboratory activity using an interactive simulation and associated exercises to help the students to explore and analyze how human activities may affect the natural carbon cycle, and to discuss the potential effects on the Earth’s climate.

:::
 * Next, conduct a classroom/laboratory activity “Carbon Lab” (from Annenberg Learner’s Habitable Planet) to further explore the topic in an engaging manner.
 * This activity uses a simulation and associated exercises for students to explore and analyze possible anthropogenic impacts on the carbon cycle, and how such changes may impact our climate.
 * Read the overview of the Carbon Lab at  https://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/interactives/carbon/index.php
 * Do the activity described in The Carbon Cycle (Step 1, Step 2, and For Your Consideration).

:::

 * The simulator for the activity is accessible at https://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/interactives/carbon/carbon.html
  * Questions/assignments are available at the end of the activities in The Carbon Cycle (Step 1, Step 2, and For Your Consideration).

## Questions and Assignments

> section: questions

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:
* What are aerosols and what are the sources of atmospheric aerosols?
* How do atmospheric aerosols aid in the formation of clouds and precipitation?
* Explain how atmospheric aerosols can have a cooling or warming effect on the planet?
* What kind of atmospheric aerosols are emitted during volcanic eruptions?
* Which are the main atmospheric aerosols produced by anthropogenic activities and how can they affect climate?

## Additional resources
> section: resources
> id: resources

::: .teaching-notes
If you or your students would like to explore the topic further, these additional resources will be useful.
:::

1. A quiz, [What are aerosols](https://climate.nasa.gov/quizzes/clouds-aerosols-quiz/), by NASA's [EARTH RIGHT NOW](https://climate.nasa.gov/) initiative.
This quiz can be used as an additional introduction to the topic of aerosols by testing the students' prior knowledge of aerosols and through such enquiry introduces their basic characteristics.

2. A reading, [Climate Change and the Impact of Aerosol- A Literature Review](https://www.ecn.nl/publications/PdfFetch.aspx?nr=ECN-E--09-095), B. Verheggen and E.P. Weijers, Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands [(ECN)](https://www.ecn.nl/)
This reading provides a literature review to assess the role of aerosols in affecting global climate.

3. A visualization, [Exploring Aerosol Optical Thickness Using MODIS Satellite Imagery in NEO](https://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/datasheets/aerosolopticalthick.html) by Science Education Resource Centre [(SERC)](https://serc.carleton.edu/index.html)
This lesson plan provides a dataset from NASA Earth Observations for students to explore and use various ways to analyse and represent the data by changing the parameters for observations.
