# Infrared Spectroscopy and the Greenhouse Gas Effect

## Overview
> section: overview

As an undergraduate-level Organic Chemistry teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you teach infrared (IR) spectroscopy and the use of IR spectra to detect functional groups in organic molecules. 

The lesson plan will help students differentiate between IR active molecules and IR inactive molecules. It focuses on the behavior of molecules of gases such as CO2 and water vapor when they interact with IR radiation and helps in explaining the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Organic Chemistry.

## IR Spectroscopy
> section: intro
> format: Video
> duration: 7 min

::: .teaching-notes
A micro-lecture (video) that introduces the topic of Infrared Spectroscopy.
:::

Introduction to the topic of Infrared spectroscopy:-

* Use the micro-lecture on **Infrared spectroscopy (IR)** to explain what happens when a molecule is exposed to IR radiation. 
* Explain that a molecule absorbs IR energy when the frequency of stretching or bending of the molecular bonds corresponds to that of the incident IR light. 
* Use this video to explain the basic working of an IR spectrometer that is used to obtain the IR spectra for known/unknown molecules. 
* Further, with the help of the video, briefly explain how the functional groups present in a molecule can be deduced by examining its IR spectrum.

## Chemistry Vignettes: IR Spectroscopy
> section: video2
> format: Video
> duration: 4 min

::: .teaching-notes
A video that explains how the functional groups of a molecule can be identified by examining its IR spectrum.
:::

Discuss how the pattern of the IR radiation absorption spectrum can be used to determine the functional groups present in the molecule. 

Emphasize that every peak in the IR spectrum is characterized by its frequency, intensity, and shape of the band, and that these factors depend on the type of functional group present in the molecule. 

Further, use the video to describe the fingerprint region of the IR spectrum; this region can be used to identify an unknown organic molecule.

## Chemistry Vignettes: Vibrational Modes
> section: video3
> format: Video
> duration: 7 min

::: .teaching-notes
A video that describes the vibrational modes of polyatomic molecules and how these modes determine whether the molecules are IR inactive or IR active.
:::

Play the video micro-lecture **Chemistry Vignettes: Vibrational Modes** to describe the vibrational modes of polyatomic molecules. 

Explain that only some vibrational modes (*those that lead to a fluctuating dipole*) result in absorption of IR light energy. 

Introduce the terms “IR active molecules” and “IR inactive molecules” by using the CO2 molecule as an example and describe its different modes of vibration.

## Greenhouse Gases
> section: video4
> format: Video
> duration: 8 min

::: .teaching-notes
A micro-lecture that explains why most IR active polyatomic gas molecules are greenhouse gases.
:::

Play the **[video/micro-lecture](https://uchicago.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3cb14d69-1c9d-49bd-8af2-ac6901295ad0)** about the Greenhouse Gases to describe the various modes of vibration in polyatomic gas molecules.

* Use the video to discuss the development of a charge imbalance (electrical dipole) in molecules due to the asymmetrical stretching or bending modes of vibration. 

* Explain that this results in the absorption of heat energy from incident IR radiation in gas molecules such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and methane (CH4); therefore, these gases trap the heat energy in the atmosphere and act as greenhouse gases.

## Greenhouse Gases
> section: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes
A **[reading](http://forecast.uchicago.edu/chapter4.pdf)** discusses the vibrational modes of water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules in detail and explains why these gases act as greenhouse gases.
:::

* Use the associated Reading from [Prof. David Archer](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/david-archer/)’s book “Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast”, available at (pg. 29-32), for a detailed description of how chemical bonds respond to incident IR light. 
* Explain that due to electrical dipole moments developed during molecular vibrations, some bonds absorb IR energy of specific frequencies. 
* Use this reading to explain the various vibrational modes in polyatomic gas molecules such as water vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2).
* Reiterate that the absorption of incident IR radiation by these gas molecules in certain vibrational modes makes them greenhouse gases.
