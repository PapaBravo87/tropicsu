# Climate Change Impact on Sea Turtles 

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school Biological Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about chromosomal and environmental sex determination in various species, and the factors that influence sex determination in sea turtles.
This lesson plan allows students to learn about the mechanisms for determination of gender in different species, and specifically, in sea turtles. The activity will help students understand the possible effects of climate change (specifically, increase in temperature) on the sex ratio and population of sea turtles.

__Grade Level__: High school    
__Discipline__: Biological Sciences  
__Topics__: Sex Determination in Species, Chromosomal Sex Determination, Environmental Sex Determination (ESD), Sea Turtle Biology, Biodiversity, Ecology  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Biosphere  
__Location__: Global,  Florida (USA)    
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)
__Duration__: 80-90 min

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe chromosomal and environmental sex determination in species
* discuss the role of environmental factors in sex determination of sea turtles
* explain the potentially adverse effects of climate change on sea turtle population
* discuss and predict the impact of climate change on ecosystems

## Introduction to Sex Determination in Species
> section: intro
> id: video1
> format: Video
> duration: 6 min

::: .teaching-notes
* A micro-lecture (video) that introduces the topic of sex determination in various biological species and explains the influence of environmental factors such as temperature on sex determination in some species. 
* Discuss chromosomal and environmental sex determination with examples.
:::

Following short video introduces the topics of sex determination, chromosomal sex determination in various biological systems, and the role of environmental factors in determining the sex of some species.

## Sex Determination in Sea Turtles
> section: video
> id: video2
> format: Video
> duration: 8 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Discuss environmental sex determination in sea turtles and emphasize the possible impact of climate change on sea turtle populations. You may briefly introduce the topic of climate change to your students now. 
* Play the video to explain how an increase in Earth's temperature due to climate change might adversely alter the sex ratio of sea turtles and might subsequently impact sea turtle population.
:::

::: column.grow  
 * Sea turtles have been on the planet for about 110 million years. Animals like turtles, crocodiles, and alligators, rely on a concept called temperature-dependent sex determination (or TDS) to dictate the sex of their offspring. 
 * In the case of turtles, warming waters and sands are altering the TDS process and in turn their the sex ratio.
 * Following video discusses how an increase in Earth's temperature due to climate change might adversely alter the sex ratio of sea turtles and might subsequently impact sea turtle population.

## Relationship between Sea Turtles and Climate Change
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Conduct a classroom activity in Part 4 of the teaching module "Sea Turtle Sex and Climate Change" to explore the topic in more detail.
* Help the students to build the model, vary the parameters values and analyse the  possible effects of climate change on the sex ratio and population of sea turtles.
:::

* Use this resource to identify the relationship between Sea Turtles population and climate change. 
* This activity will help the users to build models of sea turtle nests, simulate the effects of rising temperature due to climate change by using different light sources, collect data, and discuss the possible effects of climate change on the sex ratio and population of sea turtles.

::: column.grow  
 * From the Attachments section, download the files "sea turtle lab setup.bmp", "sea turtle lab setup 2.bmp", and "Sea Turtle Sex and Climate Change Student Lab Handout.docx".
 * Then, complete the activity described in Part 4 (Laboratory Activity and Analysis Questions).
 * You can collect and analyze the data as described in the activity, and can then discuss the possible effects of climate change on sea turtle populations.
