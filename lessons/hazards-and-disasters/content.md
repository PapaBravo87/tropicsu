# Hazards and Disasters

## Overview
> section: overview

::: column.grow
As a high school or undergraduate Geography or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching topics such as Hazards, and Disasters: Natural and Man-made.

This lesson plan allows students to understand how the melting of polar ice due to climate change can result in an increase in sea levels globally.

The activity will also allow students to examine real data on sea-level rise, determine the reasons for climate change-related flooding, and visualize the effects of such flooding on vulnerable coastal regions.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Geography or Earth Sciences.

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe the relationship between climate and the cryosphere, and the possible impact of an increase in average global temperature on sea levels
*  explain sea-level rise and the reasons for the rise
* discuss the factors that determine the vulnerability of coastal regions to inundation caused by rising sea-levels

## Climate and the Cryosphere
> section: intro
> format: Classroom/Laboratory Activity
> duration: 90 min

::: .teaching-notes
A classroom/laboratory activity that introduces the relationship between climate and the cryosphere, explains how sea-level rise can be predicted (based on average global temperature change), and triggers a discussion on the potential impacts of sea-level rise.

* Introduce the relationship between climate and the cryosphere, and the effect of increasing average global 
temperature on sea levels by conducting the classroom/laboratory activity, 

  [“Future of the Cryosphere: Sea Level Rise”](https://serc.carleton.edu/eslabs/cryosphere/6b.html)

* Discuss the impact of rising sea levels for a specific location.

## Rising Sea Levels
> section: video
> id: video1
> format: Video
> duration: 7 min

::: .teaching-notes
 Introduce the topic of heat transport in the atmosphere and Hadley Cell by playing the micro-lecture.
:::

Now, play the video “Rising Sea Levels”, from NBC Learn’s Changing Planet, to discuss how coastal communities are likely to be impacted by an increase in sea levels worldwide.

## Sea Level Rise In California
> section: activity
> format: Classroom/Laboratory Activity and Visualization
> duration: 90 min

::: .teaching-notes

Please refer only to the particular segment based on the grade level of the students:-

* High School (Section A)

* Undergraduates (Section B)   

:::

### Section A

*  Explore the topic in an interactive and engaging manner by using the *visualization* (maps and tools), **OCOF Our Coast Our Future Flood Map**.

* Facilitate an activity in which students can change the amounts of sea-level rise and storm scenario frequency, and observe the corresponding effects for specific locations on the coast of California.

* Compare and discuss various flooding scenarios and the vulnerability of different locations.

### Section B

* Explore the topic through a hands-on *classroom/laboratory activity*, **Mapping Coastal Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise at Point Reyes National Seashore**.

* In this activity, students will examine actual data for sea-level change, and will perform data analysis and calculations in MS Excel to determine coastal vulnerability and shoreline response to sea-level rise.

* Conduct the activity described in the [PowerPoint presentation](https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/files/sp/ssac/examples/ssacgnp.gb450.lv1.ppt "Click To Download the presentation").

## Questions and Assignments
> section: questions

Use this lesson plan to help your students find answers to:

 1.  Name the largest glaciers (in terms of volume) in the world.
 2.  What would be the impact of the melting of large glaciers on coastal locations across the world?
 3. What are the factors that determine the vulnerability of a coastline to flooding caused by rising sea levels?
 4. What is the likely impact of a sea-level rise of 100 cm on San Francisco and Los Angeles?
