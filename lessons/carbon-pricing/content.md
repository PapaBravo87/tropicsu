## What is the Carbon Pricing?
> section: reading1
> format: Reading
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use the following reading to introduce and describe in detail, the different aspects of global carbon pricing and its importance as an instrument for climate policies.

:::

* Use the reading, 'Carbon Pricing Dashboard' by World Bank to introduce the topic of carbon pricing.
* Play the embedded video, 'Climate Countdown: Carbon Pricin' by Connect4Climate (~5 min), to understand the importance of carbon pricing.
* Use the sub-sections in the reading resource to know more about what is carbon pricing, what are the main types of carbon pricing, and why it is important for governmental or organizational policy making.
* Use the text to also distinguish between international and national/subnational/regional carbon pricing.
* Finally, get introduced to the concept of internal carbon pricing and the factors that determine it.

## What is Shadow and Market Price?

> section: reading2
> format: Reading
> duration: 40-50 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading to introduce the topic of Shadow and Market Prices and to explain concepts such as Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), Shadow Price of Carbon (SPC), and Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) in the context of internal carbon pricing in the UK.

:::

* Use the reading, 'The Social Cost of Carbon and the Shadow Price of Carbon: what they are, and how to use them in economic appraisal in the UK' by Richard Price and Simeon Thornton and Stephen Nelson, Economics Group, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), London, to understand the concepts of shadow prices and market prices and to establish the link between them.
* Use this paper to understand the need for climate informed policies in the economic assessment of a country.
* Given its significance in greenhouse gas emissions, use carbon as an example to discuss the social costs of carbon and its shadow price in internal carbon pricing.
* Further, compare the marginal abatement costs and social costs of carbon for different stabilization goals as determined by the Stern Review.
* Finally, explore the concept of discounting and discount rates for calculating carbon prices.
* This reading uses the United Kingdom (UK) as the area of study but this reading can be discussed in the context of other regions.

## Global Carbon Pricing 
> section: activity
> format: Activity
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use an interactive visualization tool with map, data and downloadable graphs to discuss the carbon pricing initiatives of various nations over a thirty-year timeline.

:::

* Use the interactive map and data, 'Carbon Pricing Dashboard- Map & Data' by World Bank, to visualize the information available on the carbon pricing initiatives implemented by several nations over the past thirty years.
* Use the tabs to navigate to data available on the greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon prices implemented across different countries and the value of the carbon pricing initiatives selected (ETS or Carbon Tax).
* Explore different regions or countries, download the data/graphs on their carbon pricing data and draw comparisons to improve understanding of the real-world scenario of carbon pricing across various geographies.
