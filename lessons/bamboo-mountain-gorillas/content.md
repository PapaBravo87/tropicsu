# Bamboo, Mountain Gorillas and Climate 

## Overview
> section: overview

Mountain Gorillas inhabit sub-montane and montane habitats in two regions of Central Africa- the Bwindi and the Virunga areas bordering the countries of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Uganda. These isolated populations are effectively ecological islands, as the lower reaches of these regions are inhabited by rural communities. Environmental degradation due to climate change and anthropogenic activities is severely affecting the natural dietary and ranging patterns of Mountain Gorillas, and thereby endangering their survival in the wild. This lesson plan includes resources to help understand these issues.

The lesson plan will describe how Bamboo, their preferred food and an integral component of their diet, is now extensively being planted in Uganda to restore degraded forest ecosystems and provide resources for sustainable living and economically viable livelihoods to local human settlements. Thus, Bamboo cultivation helps in restoring the natural habitat and provides sustainable livelihoods to local communities and thereby, help to conserve Mountain Gorillas.

This lesson plan, thus, allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Environmental Sciences or Biological Sciences (Conservation of Endangered Species).

## Ecological Niches
> section: intro
> format: Reading
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
This reading defines and introduces the topic of ecological niches and the biogeography of a species. 

It also explains how ecological niches determine the stability of ecosystems and the biodiversity of a region.
:::

### Step By Step Guide

* Use this reading, ‘Ecological niches’ by Britannica.com, to define the ecological niche of a species, describe its characteristics and explain the factors involved in defining it.

* Use the examples given in the text to explain how natural selection works on the physical and biological constraints of a species in a given environment, and thereby determines the ‘niche’ that it occupies within elaborate ecosystems.

* Discuss how this ‘niche’ cannot be shared with another species competing for the same resources.

* Further, discuss how the biodiversity of a region is defined by these ecological niches that permit a wide variety of species to coexist with a finite set of resources.

* Navigate to the section on ‘Biogeographic aspects of biodiversity’ and use it to define the biogeography of a species.

* Use the embedded link to help explain ‘island biogeography’ and to describe the factors involved in the colonization of this controlled area of study, by different species of flora and fauna.

* Explain how isolated land areas like mountaintops and fragmented forests also follow the rules of island biogeography for species colonization.

* Discuss the examples given in the text to support this theory.

## Climate Change and Biodiversity in Uganda
> section: reading1
> format: Reading
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes

A reading that describes how climatic and non-climatic anthropogenic factors can affect the natural ecosystems and biodiversity of Uganda.

Also this overview provides an assessment of how biodiversity and ecosystem services are likely to be affected by climate change in the geographical regions of the Albertine Rift and Karamoja, as well as potential adaptation strategies for addressing these impacts.

(Go to the Reading) page 10, 11,12, section 2.2 & 2.3
:::

### Step By Step Guide

1. Use section 2.2, page 10 and 11, of the reading, [Climate Change and Biodiversity in Uganda](https://www.climatelinks.org/sites/default/files/asset/document/Uganda%2520CC%2520and%2520Biodiversity%2520Overview_CLEARED_0.pdf) by Climatelinks (USAID), to discuss how a changing climate is likely to influence the natural ecosystems of Uganda.
    * Use the points enumerated to describe different scenarios of climate change and the subsequent disruptions in the ecological balance between species and the flora and fauna distribution in Uganda.
    * Discuss how these disturbances could affect the ecological niches occupied by various species and their abilities to adapt to such changes within a short span of time.
2. Use section 2.3, page 12, of the same reading to also describe the possible effects of non-climatic (anthropogenic) factors on Uganda’s biodiversity and ecosystems
3. Explain how the effect of these factors may be exacerbated by climate related factors: for example, droughts leading to exploitation and agricultural expansion into forest habitats.

## Mountain Gorillas in Uganda
> section: reading2
> format: Reading
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
A case study of climate-induced habitat changes for Mountain Gorillas in Uganda that is putting their survival at risk.
(Go to the Reading )Page 21, Box 5
:::

### Step By Step Guide

* Use the reading, ‘Box 5: Mountain gorillas in the Virunga mountains face new threats as their habitat changes’ on page 21 from ‘Wildlife in a changing climate’ by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), to discuss the case study of how climate change and anthropogenic activities are affecting the natural habitat and range distribution of Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
* Apply the understanding from the previous section to explain how climate and non-climate stressors can affect the ecological balance and thus, the natural feeding and ranging patterns of the Mountain Gorillas.
* Explain that increased temperatures may move the growth of vegetation to higher altitudes and force them to inhabit higher areas. However, due to the tapering nature of the mountaintops, Gorilla habitat gets further restricted.
* Discuss how climate induced shifting bamboo cover not only adversely affects food availability for the Gorillas but also resource availability for people dependent on it thus, bringing them in direct conflict with each other.
* Further, explain that changing climatic conditions and heavy reliance on forest resources by humans has resulted in large scale habitat degradation putting further constraints on the physical and biological well-being of the species, making them more vulnerable to climate change.

## Project Mountain Gorilla
> section: reading3
> format: Reading
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
Improve understanding of the Mountain Gorillas’ habitat degradation due to climate related factors.
:::

### Step By Step Guide

* Use the reading, ‘Case #8 Mountain Gorillas, Ecosystem Services and Local Livelihoods in Rwanda, Uganda and DRC’, section 9.8, pages 45-47 of the report, [BIODIVERSITY, CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT- HARNESSING SYNERGIES AND CELEBRATING SUCCESSES](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/biodiversity_climate_change_sustainable_development_technical_report.pdf) by Guy Midgley et al, provided by UNFCC, to discuss the implications of climate change on Mountain Gorillas and the livelihoods of local communities in the Virunga region.
* Initiate classroom discussions on the findings of the report that mainly point towards restoration of Gorilla habitat through reforestation efforts for Gorilla conservation.
* Also, explain how the burden on forest resources due to human activity, can be reduced by using alternative resources like fast growing renewable Bamboo plants that can be creatively harnessed for sustainable living and for providing livelihoods in local communities.
* Finally, discuss how large-scale Bamboo planting could not only provide adequate food for Gorillas but also help restore degraded forest ecosystems and thus, be an effective climate adaptation strategy.
