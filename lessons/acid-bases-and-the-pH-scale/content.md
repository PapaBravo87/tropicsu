# Acids Bases & The pH Scale

## Overview
>section: overview

As a high school Chemistry teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help yourself in teaching the pH scale, acids and bases, acidification, and environmental chemistry.

This lesson plan allows students to understand the pH scale and acidification by analyzing the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on ocean chemistry. 

The activity ,introduced further, will also explore the potential effects of climate change on ocean acidification, and the possible impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms. 

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

*  describe the pH scale
*  explain ocean acidification
*  discuss the effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide on ocean chemistry
*  determine the potential effects of climate change on ocean acidification
*  explore the possible impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms

## Acids and bases
>section: intro
>format: Visualization
>duration: ~45 min 

::: .teaching-notes

* Introduce the topic of acids and bases.
* Proceed with your existing lesson plan to explain the pH scale.
* Discuss the pH values of various common compounds.
* Give a few examples of chemical reactions that generate acids and bases.

Note: The tool below requires a Flash player, and therefore, may not play in some browsers. The visualization tool works well in Firefox and MS Edge.

:::

### Visualzation: Our Acidifying Ocean

* Use “part 1” of the visualization, “Our Acidifying Ocean,” from the Inquiry to Student Environmental Action (I2SEA) project for an interactive learning session. 

* The tool will help you introduce the topics of pH scale, pH of different liquids, ocean acidification, and possible impacts of ocean acidification on marine life.

* It is available in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish.

## Ocean Acidification
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 18 min

Play this video “Ocean Acidification”, to explain how carbon dioxide (CO2) affects the pH of the ocean and how an increase in ocean acidification might adversely impact marine animals.

## Ocean Acidification and Oysters Lab
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes

Explore this topic in an engaging manner through a classroom/laboratory activity, “Ocean Acidification and Oysters Lab”, created by Hilary Palevsky, UW Oceanography.

This activity will help your students explore how a change in ocean chemistry can affect the growth of marine organisms, specifically, oyster larvae. 

Students will use actual data from the Whiskey Creek Hatchery in Oregon, USA, to plot graphs in MS Excel, and perform data analysis and interpretation.

:::

A Classroom/Laboratory Activity, “Ocean Acidification and Oysters Lab” by	**Hilary Palevsky, UW Oceanography, University of Washington Program on Climate Change** to explore and analyze the relationship between the growth of oyster larvae and the chemistry of ocean water (aragonite saturation state) by using actual data from the Whiskey Creek Hatchery in Oregon, USA.

* First, download the contents from the link given below.

* Read the content in the Oysters and Ocean Acidification Module (PDF file).

* Conduct the activity described in Part 1 of the module (plotting and analysis of actual data by using MS Excel).

*Optional: You may also perform the activities in Part 2 and Part 3, depending on the time available for teaching this topic.*

## Questions and Assignments
> section: questions

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:
* What is the pH value of ocean water? Is it alkaline or acidic?
* What are the main chemical reactions in ocean acidification?
* How could an increase in fossil fuel usage change the pH value of ocean water?
* If ocean water became more acidic, how might it affect oyster and sea urchin populations?
* What are the possible impacts of climate change on ocean chemistry?
