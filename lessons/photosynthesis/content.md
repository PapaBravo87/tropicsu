# Impact of Climate Change on Photosynthesis

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Biological Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching photosynthesis, factors affecting photosynthesis, and the impact of increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 and some climate-related factors on photosynthesis.
This lesson plan enables students to understand the process of photosynthesis in plants and the various factors that influence it. Students will explore how changes in climate related factors such as CO2 levels, temperature, water availability can influence photosynthesis, thereby impacting plant growth and agricultural yields. A hands-on lab activity will enable students to assess the change in the rate of photosynthesis when CO2 concentration changes.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in the Biological Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High School, Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Biological Sciences

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* Define photosynthesis.
* List the various factors that influence photosynthesis.
* Discuss the possible effects of elevated levels of CO2 on field-grown plants.

## Introdcution to Photosynthesis
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 12 min

::: .teaching-notes
Introduce the topic by playing the video micro-lecture, 'Photosynthesis' from bozemanscience.
This video explains the process of photosynthesis, chloroplasts and photoreceptors, the light reaction and the Calvin cycle, and an overview of C3, C4, and CAM plants.
:::

Use the following video in which Paul Andersen explains the process of photosynthesis by which plants and algae can convert carbon dioxide into useable sugar. He begins with a brief description of the chloroplast. He describes the major pigments in a plant (like chlorophyll a and b). He then describes both the light reaction and the Calvin cycle.

## Plant Response to Climate Change
> section: video2
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 7.5 min

::: .teaching-notes
Play a video micro-lecture to disucss about how plants have evolved to respond differently to changing climatic conditions.
:::

This micro-lecture explains the possible influence of CO2 levels and climate change on the growth of plants and consequently on vegetation and crop productivity.

## Responses of C3 and C4 plants
> section: reading
> id: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 20 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading to discuss the difference in the responses of C3 and C4 plants to rising levels of atmospheric CO2.
:::

* Use the reading 'Effects of Rising Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide on Plants' from Nature Education to understand the effects of elevated CO2 levels on the photosynthetic efficiency of field-grown plants.
* This reading states that plant physiology and biochemical compositions change in response to high CO2 availability. Secondary effects like changes in stomatal conductance affect efficiency of carbon fixation and water uptake in plants. 

::: column.grow
* Explore the differences in the responses of C3 and C4 plants under these conditions.

## Measure The Rate of Photosynthesis
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
Conduct a classroom/laboratory activity to measure the rate at which photosynthesis occurs and note changes under variable conditions such as elevated carbon dioxide levels, a potential contributor to climate change.
:::

* This activity can be used to explore, measure, and determine the rate at which photosynthesis occurs
* This lab activity allows the users to test the rate of photosynthesis under variable environmental conditions like light intensity, temperature, carbon dioxide levels.

::: column.grow
* Note the changes in the rate of photosynthesis and compare the results.
* In this lab activity, one can test the effect of elevated CO2 levels on the rate of photosynthesis on spinach leaves by testing under different concentrations of added sodium bicarbonate. Students can then discuss how the rate at which photosynthesis occurs can affect food production in plants and thereby, affect agricultural produce in
general.
