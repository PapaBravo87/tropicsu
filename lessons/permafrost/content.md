# Permafrost and Climate Change

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Geography, Environmental Sciences or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about permafrost, the nature and distribution of permafrost in the Earth’s cryosphere, thawing of permafrost due to global warming which in turn, results in the release of a potent greenhouse gas methane; and therefore, the possible impacts of permafrost thawing on climate.
This lesson plan introduces the topic of permafrost and the observed thawing of permafrost in recent times due to rising global temperatures. A computer-based activity/model helps in exploring the possible impacts of permafrost thawing on the Earth’s climate. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Geography, Environmental Sciences or Earth Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High school, undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Geography, Environmental Sciences, Earth Sciences  
__Topics__: Permafrost, Methane, Thawing of Permafrost, Global Warming Methanogens, Greenhouse Gases Emissions  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Cryosphere, The greenhouse effect

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe permafrost and its characteristics
* discuss the changing nature and distribution of permafrost on Earth
* explain the possible effects of thawing of permafrost on Earth’s climate
* interpret, analyze, and predict trends in data from permafrost-related datasets

## Introduction to Permafrost
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 7 min

::: .teaching-notes
 * Use a video that introduces permafrost and its distribution on Earth. The video also describes the changing nature of permafrost across several regions due to higher surface temperatures and the possible impact of permafrost thawing on Earth’s climate owing to the release of methane, a greenhouse gas.
 * Continue by facilitating a discussion.
:::

Play the video 'Thawing Permafrost' by NBC Learn, to get introduced to the topic of permafrost. Use the video to understand the characteristics of permafrost and its distribution across the globe. Then, explore how permafrost is used to study soil conditions for periods dating back to several thousands of years by drilling boreholes and extracting ice cores for analyses.

::: column.grow  
  * Discuss how higher surface temperatures cause changes in permafrost conditions, leading to the thawing of permafrost in many regions. Further, discuss how this thawing has led to local environmental perturbations such as sinkholes, landslides, increased vegetation, and an enhanced active-layer bacterial activity.

* Finally, explore how permafrost thawing can lead to the release of greenhouse gases such as methane to the atmosphere which can in turn, impact the Earth’s climate.

## Investigate permafrost characteristics : for High school
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 30-45 min

::: .teaching-notes
 * Use a set of hands-on classroom and computer-based activities to teach about permafrost and use various web-based scientific data portals to help the students to investigate permafrost distribution, characteristics of permafrost, and the effects of thawing permafrost on the atmosphere and the environment.
 * The plan includes 3-4 activities; one or more of these activities can be conducted. The time required for each activity is specified in the summary table of the laboratory plan.
:::

 
::: column.grow
 Use the laboratory plan 'Changing Planet: Permafrost Gas Leak' to:
 * investigate permafrost characteristics
 * understand borehole data and identify the trends in the data observed
 * find a correlation between atmospheric methane data and permafrost thawing data
 
 Follow the instructions provided in the plan to complete these laboratory activities. Each activity can be conducted separately. The relevant reading material and links for datasets and worksheets are given in the main text or in the table (under the “Materials” section).

## Investigate permafrost characteristics : for Undergraduate
> section: activity1
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 45 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use a computer-based model/ simulation to observe and compare the changes in the concentration of methane in the global atmosphere when compared with normal trends (resulting from natural and anthropogenic emissions), when a sudden increase in methane (as an effect of thawing of permafrost) is introduced.
* The model/ simulation also enables students to observe the radiative forcing of methane when compared with that of carbon dioxide under similar conditions.
:::

* Use the model/simulation 'METHANE in the Atmosphere' by Prof. David Archer, University of Chicago, to observe the methane concentration in the atmosphere under different hypothetical conditions and timescales. Large-scale thawing of the Earth's permafrost can lead to a sudden release of the greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere. 

{div.large-link} [Model 'METHANE in the Atmosphere'](http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/methane/)

* Go to Model Metadata. Then, click the 'Overview' tab to read about the model.

{div.large-link} [Model Metadata](http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/methane/methane.doc.html)

* Next, play the 'Video Introduction' to understand how the model can be used to simulate sudden methane perturbations in the atmosphere. Observe the subsequent impact on its atmospheric concentration.

::: column.grow
 * Now, run the model to-
	* note changes in atmospheric methane concentration or
	* track the atmospheric methane budget (source versus sink) or
	* observe atmospheric methane persistence over time or
	* compare the radiative forcing of atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide
	* when different amounts of methane are released into the atmosphere over varying time scales.

:::

* Use the data points generated to draw graphs representing different scenarios of methane perturbations. Use these representations to discuss the implications of methane release in the atmosphere due to the large-scale thawing of permafrost.

* What is permafrost? Where is it found?
* What changes have been observed in permafrost characteristics in recent times?
* What is the active layer of the soil? How is it affected when permafrost thaws?
* Why is methane, a greenhouse gas, released into the atmosphere when permafrost thaws?
