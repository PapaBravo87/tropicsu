# Introduction to Climate Change

## What is Climate Change?
> section: overview

<cite>Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years).
Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather within the context of longer-term average conditions.
--[IPCC, AR4, 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC)
</cite>

<p>
This special lesson is aimed to teachers, as an introduction to the topic of climate change with an special emphasis on why and how it should be introduced into the curriculum of their students.

## The teacher friendly guide to Climate Change
> section: guide
> id: guide
> format: Book

This book from researchers and educators at the Paleontological Research Institution (Ithaca, New York, USA) is a good starting point for all teachers that seek a presentation of the basics of climate change science and perspectives on teaching. Attention is given to communities of learners across all the existing polarized spectrum of opinions.

This "teacher-friendly" guide is aimed primarily to high school Earth science teachers but also to teachers of other disciplines and grades. It presents the scientific aspects of climate change science, the net negative impact on many people, and also the consequences that scientific community foresees if we do not take action to slow it down.

## Role of human factors
> section: human-factors
> format: Web key resource

This website from NASA, _Global Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet_ addresses concisely four main questions:
* Evidence. How do we know climate change is real?
* Causes. Why is climate change happening?
* Effects. What are the effects of climate change?
* Solutions. What is being done to solve climate change?

## The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
> section: ipcc
> format: Web key resource

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.

The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.

## Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
> section: ndc
> format: Web key resource

The website _Climate Watch_ offers open data, visualizations and analysis to help policymakers, researchers and other stakeholders gather insights on countries' climate progress.

{div.large-link} [Climate Watch Data](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/).

Amongst other data, it provides information on the [Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ndcs-content), which are the goals and commitments that each country sets to address the climate change, such as Greenhouse gases emissions and other polluants emissions, or renewable energy migrations.


{div.credit} Climate Watch is a platform set up by a collaboration of many [partners](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/about/partners), it is hosted by the World Resources Institute and is part of the [Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/) family of data platforms.
