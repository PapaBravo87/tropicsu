# The Carbon Cycle

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Chemistry or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching topics in environmental chemistry such as the carbon cycle or biogeochemical cycles.
This lesson plan allows students to understand the carbon cycle, its components, and the flow among the different components of this biogeochemical cycle. The activity will introduce the link between the carbon cycle and climate. It will also explore how human activity (such as increased fossil fuel use) may affect the natural carbon cycle, and may thus cause climate-related changes.
Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.

### Learning outcomes

* describe the global carbon cycle and its components
* explain the flow among the components in the carbon cycle
* discuss the role of the carbon cycle in climate
* analyze and discuss the impact of human activities (such as the use of fossil fuels) on CO2 levels in the carbon cycle
* predict the possible effects of excess carbon in the system on the Earth’s climate

## Introduction to Global Carbon Cycle
> section: intro
> id: diagram
> format: diagram
> duration: 20 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use an interactive diagram that introduces the global carbon cycle, its components, and the flow among the various components through video clips and images.

:::

::: column.grow
 Topic introduction 
 * Get introduced to the topic of the global carbon cycle by using the interactive diagram “Carbon Cycle”, from the Science Learning Hub (New Zealand).
 * Try to observe the components of the carbon cycle and observe the flow among these parts. You can interact with the components by clicking on them to learn more details.

## Relation Between Carbon Cycle and The Earth’s Climate
> section: reading
> id: reading
> format: reading
> duration: 20 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading that provides an overview of the carbon cycle, and explains the link between the carbon cycle and the Earth’s climate.

:::

Extend your understanding of the topic using a reading.

::: column.grow
* Use the reading “The Carbon Cycle and Earth’s Climate” from Columbia University to understand details of the carbon cycle, some of the chemical reactions involved in the cycle, and the role of the carbon cycle in the Earth’s climate.

## Carbon Cycle and Anthropogenic Activities
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: activity
> duration: 60-70 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use a classroom/ laboratory activity using an interactive simulation and associated exercises to explore and analyze how human activities may affect the natural carbon cycle, and to discuss the potential effects on the Earth’s climate.

:::

* Next, take a classroom/laboratory activity “Carbon Lab” to further explore the topic in an engaging manner.
* This activity uses a simulation and associated exercises for students to explore and analyze possible anthropogenic impacts on the carbon cycle, and how such changes may impact our climate.

::: column.grow
* Read the overview of the Carbon Lab [here](https://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/interactives/carbon/index.php).
* Take the activity described in The Carbon Cycle as Step 1, Step 2, and For Your Consideration.
* Questions/assignments are available at the end of the activities in The Carbon Cycle (Step 1, Step 2, and For Your Consideration).

## Questions and Assignments

> section: questions

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

1. What is the role of weathering of rocks in the carbon cycle? What are the chemical reactions in this process?
2. Which components in the carbon cycle act as carbon sinks?
3. If fossil fuel usage increases, what would be the effect on the different carbon sinks? What would be the possible changes in the Earth’s climate?
4. What are the possible impacts of deforestation on the natural carbon cycle? How might these changes affect the Earth’s climate?
