# Cost Benefit Analysis

## Overview
> section: overview

As an undergraduate Economics teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching cost-benefit analysis.
This lesson plan will help students to understand the principles of cost-benefit analysis. The activities will allow students to apply cost-benefit analysis to global climate change, in general, and to carbon abatement (an action to mitigate climate change).
Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Economics.

__Grade Level__: Undergraduate  
__Discipline__:	 Economics  
__Topic(s) in Discipline__:	Cost-Benefit Analysis, Carbon Abatement, Energy, Economics and Climate Change  
__Climate Topic__: Energy, Economics, and Climate Change, Policies, Politics, and Environmental Governance, Mitigation  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)  
__Duration__: 150-170 min  

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe cost-benefit analysis
* apply cost-benefit analysis to global climate change
* apply cost-benefit analysis to carbon emissions abatement

## What is Cost-Benefit Analysis
> section: intro
> format: Reading
> duration: 20–30 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Introduce the topic of cost-benefit analysis and its principles by using the following reading.

:::

::: column.grow

* Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is the process of quantifying costs and benefits of a decision, program, or project (over a certain period), and those of its alternatives (within the same period), in order to have a single scale of comparison for unbiased evaluation.
* CBA helps to analyse decisions by summing the benefits of a situation or action and then subtracting the costs associated with taking that action.
* Read the topic of cost-benefit analysis and its principles by using the following reading.

## Economic Analysis of Climate Change
> section: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 45 – 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading to discuss the economic analysis of climate change and specifically, cost-benefit studies of global climate change.

:::

::: column.grow

* Following reading introduces the economic analysis of climate change and discusses cost-benefit studies of global climate change.
* The reading, "Economic Analysis of Climate Change: Cost-Benefit Studies of Global Climate Change" is in Ch. 2 (pg. 15-25) of "The Economics of Global Climate Change".
* This reading explores and compares the methodology used by various economic models for cost-benefit analysis of climate change.

## Cost Benefit Analysis of Carbon Emissions Abatement
> section: Activitity
> format: Activities
> duration: 60-90 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Exaplin the topic in an engaging manner by conducting the activity to perform cost-benefit analysis for carbon emissions abatement.
* Download the activity teaching materials and reading material.
* Conduct the activities as described in Part 1 and Part 2 of the unit.

::: column.grow

* Carbon abatement is defined as the reduction of the amount of carbon dioxide that is produced when coal and oil are burned.

::: column.grow

* In this activity, carbon abatement is considered to be an action that will mitigate climate change, and the costs and benefits of abating carbon emissions are calculated.
* Download the educational material and perform the activities as described in Part 1 and Part 2 of the unit.
