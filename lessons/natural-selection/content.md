# Natural Selection

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate, Biological Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about natural selection, its role in evolution and climate change as a selective pressure in natural selection.
This lesson plan will enable the students to understand Darwin's theory of natural selection. They will learn how organisms such as pocket mice and Snowshoe hares respond to changes in the environment and climate. The lesson plan will allow students to understand climate change as a selective pressure in natural selection and how it plays a role in the evolutionary rescue of a species that would otherwise be endangered due to climate change.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in the Biological Sciences.

## Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection
> section: intro
> id: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use an in-chapter reading to briefly introduce Darwin's theory of natural selection to the students.
Explain Mendel's work about inheritance of favored characteristics. 
:::

::: column.grow
Charles Darwin was a British naturalist who proposed the theory of biological evolution by 'natural selection'. Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. 
The concept of natural selection was published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858. It was elaborated in Darwin's book 'On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life' in 1859.

* Use the in-chapter reading, 'Major Themes in Evolution', from the National Academies Press (Chapter 3, pgs 11-16) to get introduction of the topic of natural selection.
* Explore how Darwin and Wallace proposed the theory of natural selection on variants within a species that explained the process of evolution.
* Also explore how Mendel's work explained how favored characteristics are inherited and eventually lead to speciation.

## Natural Selection and Adaption Example of Mice
> section: video1
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a video and associated reading that shows that climate change can be a selective pressure in natural selection. It uses the example of coat colour in the Snowshoe hare populations in North America.
Use the questions from this resource to quiz students.
:::

* Use this interactive resource titled 'The Making of the Fittest: Natural Selection and Adaptation' to demonstrate an example of natural selection.

::: column.grow
* Explore how a selection pressure of dark coloured surfaces on light coloured pocket mice has resulted in a natural selection for darker coloured pocket mice that are better camouflaged against predators.

## Natural Selection and Adaption Example of Snowshoe Hare
> section: video2
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a video and associated reading that shows that climate change can be a selective pressure in natural selection. It uses the example of coat colour in the Snowshoe hare populations in North America.
:::

* Play the video, 'Will Snowshoe Hares Win the Race between Evolution and Climate Change', by National Geographic to understand how reduced snowfall due to a warming climate, behaves as a selective pressure on the seasonal coat colour polymorphism of the Snowshoe hares in North America.
Snowshoe hares change coat colour in different seasons- white when the ground is snow covered and brown when it is not-to protect themselves from predators. 
* Use the resource to confirm that that snowshoe hares from areas where the ground is snow-covered or from areas where the ground is rarely covered with snow through the year, show no seasonal change in coat colour.
* The areas in between these regions are where most hares that seasonally change their coat colour can be found.
* Use the associated reading, 'Mills Lab publishes new article in Science: Research identifies areas where evolution could rescue animals threatened by climate change' by the Mills Lab, University of Montana, to show that research on the Snowshoe hares has established that these intermediary zones are evolutionary hotspots that show a higher percentage of non- colour changing brown snowshoe hares due to the ground remaining snow free for longer as a result of a warming climate.
* Explain how this is an example of 'Evolutionary Rescue' of a species by selection for a character that affords better protection from predators in a changing environment, in this case, due to climate change.

This video series present the scientific evidences that the Climate Change is taking place.

## Changes in single gene allelic frequencies under a varying selective pressure
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Conduct an optional computer lab-based simulation activity to illustrate the changes in single gene allelic frequencies under a varying selective pressure.
* Help the students to plot graphs depicting the changes in allele frequencies through the generations.
* Discuss with the students how a climate related change in environment could play a role in changing the allelic frequencies for the given gene.
:::

* This activity can be used to extend the understanding of natural selection by the observations of changes in allelic frequencies over successive generations, due to an adaptive advantage for varying selective pressures.
Use the simulation, 'Natural Selection' to explore how the allelic frequencies for a single gene, that codes for body colour, changes through several generations when a varying selection pressure (different environments) is applied.
* Launch the simulation and follow the instructions to run it.
Select an initial allelic frequency for alleles 'A' and 'a' of a gene for body colour in a starter population of insects, for a given
Click the 'Natural Selection' tab and then the 'Generation' button, in order from G1 to G5.
Record the data generated in table for changes in allelic frequencies over five generations.

* Use the 'Reset' button and repeat this activity for different allelic frequencies of the starter population for a varying environment.
End-point allelic frequencies can also be compared by varying the allelic frequencies at the start for a given environment.

* Try to plot graphs depicting the changes in allele frequencies through the generations.
If needed, try to use the worksheet to record the observations and fill in answers to the journal questions to provide explanations for the observations.

::: column.grow

* This exercise will help to observe the changes in allelic frequencies over successive generations. Discuss if an allele is associated with an adaptive advantage, its frequency will increase in a population and may eventually get fixed while an allele that does not have an advantageous adaptive trait, will decrease in frequency and may eventually be lost from the population.
Finally, extend your thinking by discussing how a climate related change in environment could play a role in changing the allelic frequencies for the given gene.
