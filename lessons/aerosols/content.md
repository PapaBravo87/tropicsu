# Aerosols and Climate

## Overview
> section: overview

As a High school Chemistry or Environmental Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about aerosols, their sources, and their direct and indirect impact on climate.
This lesson plan will help students understand what aerosols are and what are the major sources of atmospheric aerosols. Students will learn the importance of atmospheric aerosols by evaluating their direct and indirect role in affecting climate. They will also learn how aerosol nano particles formation impacts Earth's climate by cloud seeding and precipitation. 

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry or Environmental Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High school, Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Chemistry, Environmental Sciences  
__Topics__: Aerosols, Sources of Aerosols, Aerosol Nanoparticles, Radiative Energy Balance, Role of Aerosols in Cloud Formation, Sulphate Aerosols  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the atmosphere, The Greenhouse Gas Effect

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* what aerosols are and what are their main sources

## Introduction to Atmospheric Aerosols
> section: intro
> id: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
* A reading that explains what aerosols are and describes the different sources of atmospheric aerosols. This reading includes a section on volcanic eruptions as one of the largest natural contributors to atmospheric aerosols.
* Further describe the relation between volcanic aerosols and climate. 
* Finally, explain how aerosols are used as tracers to study global atmospheric patterns.
:::

* Aerosols are minute particles suspended in the atmosphere of the earth. Aerosols are emitted to the atmosphere directly from sources such as  volcanos, forests, traffic, sea spray, desert dust and fires. They can also be formed by condensation of atmospheric gases. 
* Use a reading, 'Atmospheric Aerosols: What Are They, and Why Are They So Important?' by the Langley Research Centre, NASA, to discuss in detail what atmospheric aerosols are and what are their main sources. Use the reading to explore in detail how aerosols can affect climate and can cause both heating and cooling on the earth's surface.

::: column.grow
* Emphasize that volcanic eruptions are amongst the largest sources of atmospheric aerosols. Using examples discussed in text, try to understand how volcanic eruptions have affected earth's climate in the past, due to the large-scale dispersal of particulate matter and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

* Further, read how the other main sources of aerosols- dust and anthropogenic sources like smoke particles and sulfate aerosols from the burning of fossil fuels- can also affect climate.

::: column.grow
* Explore how sulphate aerosols are formed in the atmosphere when sulphur dioxide reacts with water to form fine liquid droplets of sulphuric acid and solid particles of salts of sulphuric acid. Discuss how the concentration of human contributed sulfate aerosols have increased in the industrial age and how they could possibly affect earth's climate.
* It is interesting to note, how aerosols are used as tracers to study global atmospheric patterns.

## Aerosol Nanoparticle Formation
> section: video
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 6 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a video to visualize the effect of aerosols on climate specifically in their role in cloud formation. This video explains how the interaction of aerosols with gas molecules in the atmosphere helps in cloud formation.
:::

* Use an animated video, 'Aerosol Nanoparticle Formation' to visualize the interactions of aerosol particles and gas molecules in the atmosphere.
The video explains how some of these interactions result in molecular aggregates in the atmosphere, on which water condenses to form water droplets resulting in cloud formation. Clouds both absorb light from the sun and form a barrier for heat loss from the earth's surface thereby affecting the earth's radiation energy balance.
Thus, explore how aerosols have an indirect effect on climate due to their role in aiding cloud formation.

## Volcanoes and Global Warming
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Conduct an  enquiry-based classroom activity about the different atmospheric aerosols and gases released during volcanic eruptions and how they affect climate.
* This activity will help students to study data of emissions from volcanic eruptions.
* The activity is available as a PDF file.
:::

::: column.grow
* This classroom activity can be used to extend the understanding of what kind of material is ejected into the atmosphere as a result of volcanic activity i.e. ash (fine dust) and several gases. Use the text to specify that water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are the main gases released. 
* Of these, water vapour and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases and can directly contribute towards warming of the earth's surface.
* Sulphur dioxide, on the other hand, has an indirect effect on climate by forming sulfate aerosols. Emphasize on the role of these sulfate aerosols on climate as they directly absorb or reflect light energy or indirectly, through cloud formation, cause heating or cooling on the earth's surface.
* Using the data provided, try to draw bar graphs to compare the percentages of the types of gases released from volcanic eruptions in disparate geographic locations.
* Use the 'Extend Your Thinking' section to analyse two cases of volcanic eruptions in the past and the impact of sulphate aerosols on the global climate.
