# Photosynthetic Pathways and Physiological Responses to Climate Change

## Overview
> section: overview
As an undergraduate Biological Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about differences in photosynthesis in different types of plants (`C_3`, `C_4` and CAM) and how they are affected by climate change: which is more resilient or less resilient. You can discuss all these basic concepts in plant physiology using the case study: Uganda's massive expansion of Bamboo, a `C_3` plant, to address the issue of heavy deforestation, under changing climatic conditions.

This lesson plan includes resources that teach about the `C_3`, `C_4` photosynthetic pathways in plants and describes the differences in their physiological responses to changing environmental conditions like rising atmospheric concentrations of `CO_2` and temperatures. You can also use these resources to teach photorespiration, nutrient and water uptake, stomatal conductance, carbon -fixation and, more importantly, homoeostasis for photosynthetic efficiency under these varying conditions. Use this lesson plan to explain how this understanding can be applied to devise climate adaptation strategies by using the example of large-scale Bamboo plantation in Uganda.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Biological Sciences (specifically Plant Physiology).

## Introduction to Photosynthesis
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 12 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Introduce the topic by playing the video micro-lecture, _Photosynthesis_ from bozemanscience.  
* Use the video to explain how photosynthetic pathways are affected by stomatal conductance, which in turn affects nutrient and water uptake by the plants.
* Further, explain the influence of photorespiration on photosynthetic efficiencies and thereby, carbon fixation in `C_3`, `C_4` plants- use the resource, `C_3`, `C_4` _, and CAM plants. How the_ `C_4` _and CAM pathways help minimize photorespiration_ from the additional resources section, to explain this in detail.

:::

Watch this short video that introduces the topic of photosynthesis and describe the differences in `C_3`, `C_4` and CAM photosynthetic pathways in plants.

## Effect of climate change on the photosynthetic efficiencies of plants
> section: Reading
> id : reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 40 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Provide your students with printouts of the following readings to discuss the influence of climate change related factors- increased atmospheric `CO_2` and rising global temperatures-on the photosynthetic efficiencies of `C_3` and `C_4` plants.
:::

* Use the reading _Effects of Rising Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide on Plants_ from Nature Education to understand the effects of elevated `CO_2` levels on the photosynthetic efficiency of field-grown plants.
 * Use the text to understand how plant physiology and biochemical compositions change in response to high `CO_2`.
 * Secondary effects like changes in stomatal conductance affect efficiency of carbon fixation and water uptake in plants.
 * Thus, differences in the responses of `C_3` and `C_4` plants under these conditions are noted.
 * Discuss the results noting a higher rate of photosynthesis for `C_3` plants with increased `CO_2` atmospheric concentrations compared to `C_4` plants.

* Use the following reading, _Temperature response of photosynthesis in_ `C_3`, `C_4`, _and CAM plants: temperature acclimation and temperature adaptation_, to explain how the type of photosynthetic pathway determines the ability of a plant to respond to climate related temperature changes.
* Use this reading to discuss plant phenotypic plasticity, temperature acclimation and temperature adaptation in terms of photosynthetic efficiencies of `C_3` and `C_4` plants.
* Discuss this in conjunction with the perceived improved photosynthetic efficiency of `C_3` plants at higher temperatures compared to `C_4` plants.

Bamboo attributes for climate change, page 28- from _The poor man's carbon sink: Bamboo in Climate Change and Poverty Alleviation_ to discuss the attributes of Bamboo as the plant chosen to provide a fast growing and sustainable green cover to restore the human-induced fragmented forest ecosystems of Uganda.
* Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Bamboo as a climate adaptation strategy against deforestation in Uganda.
* Elaborate on the possibility of improved photosynthetic efficiency of this species under increased temperature and atmospheric `CO_2` conditions.
