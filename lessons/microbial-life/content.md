# Microbial Life

## Overview
> section: overview

This lesson plan allows students to learn about the relationship between microbes, the environment, and climate. The activity will explore the specific roles played by various microbes in the climate system.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in the Biological Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High School, Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Biological Sciences  
__Topics__: Microbes, Environment Bacterial Growth and Adaptation, Gas Cycling,Greenhouse Gases
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Biosphere  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe the relationship between microbes, the environment, and climate
* describe microbial growth and its phases, and the key factors affecting microbial growth
* discuss the possible impacts of climate change on microbes

## Introduction to Microbes
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 3 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Play this micro-lecture from RMIT University and contributed by Dr. Taghrid Istivan, to help students to get an overview of microbes, their classification, and their role in the biosphere.
* Discuss the significant role of microbes in sustaining life on earth. When teaching the topic of microbes, discuss the relationship between microbial life and climate.
:::

As climate change alters the environment, microorganisms respond, adapt, and evolve in their surroundings. Microorganisms have generation times that may be as short as a few hours; therefore, they respond to environmental and climate-related changes at a faster rate than most other organisms. Thus, microbes are ideal systems for understanding the effects of climate change on biological systems.

## Environmental factors and Microbes
> section: Animation
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 3 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Play the animation/video (approx. 3 min) 'Food Pathogens and Temperature' to illustrate how microbial growth depends on various environmental factors. 
* Use the graphs in the animation to explain the effect of changing temperature on microbial growth.  
:::

* Watch this animation/video that describes the environmental factors required for microbial growth and explains the effects of changing environmental conditions on microbial growth by using temperature as an example.
* Solve the short quiz provided with the animation.
* Explore how global warming may affect microbial growth and establish a relationship between the environment and microbes.

## Microbes and Climate Change
> section: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 50 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use the handout in the reading Microbes and Climate Change to explain the crucial role of microbes in the environment.

:::

* This reading discusses the role of microbes in ecological systems and their role in the biogeochemical cycling of elements such as carbon and nitrogen.
* Discuss the role of microbes in gas cycling, the consumption and production of greenhouse gases by microbes, and the resulting effects on climate.

::: .teaching-notes
If you or your students would like to explore the topic further, these additional resources will be useful.
:::

1. A reading, [Is Climate Change Putting World's Microbiomes at Risk?](http://www.who.int/globalchange/environment/en/chapter6.pdf) by Jim Robbins on YaleEnvironment360, that briefly describes the impact of climate change on microbial growth.
