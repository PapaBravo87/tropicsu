* Here is a suggested homework assignment of writing an informal letter as a response to the talk by Greta Thunberg following the in-class discussion.

* Use the link, ‘How to Write informal Letters in English (With Examples)’ by Owlcation.com, that introduces you to the basic rules of letter writing (salutations, sign off, and structure).
* Try to use this format to write a letter (homework assignment) to Greta Thunberg as a response to her talk.
* To complete this assignment, think about climate change and how individuals can change the situation. you may use the impressions of Thunberg’s speech, coupled with your own ideas about climate change activism and the view as activists to form the bulk of a letter that you will address to Greta Thunberg.

::: column.grow
* Here are some points which you may include in your letter:
  1. their choice of what they found most important in the talk
  2. how they feel about the issue of climate change
  3. what they do (or wish to do) about climate change

* Thus, this letter writing exercise enables two crucial skills to be tested and reinforced: one, the ability to glean and summarize information from an external source, and two: the ability to articulate one’s thoughts and opinions on an important issue and connect that to the information obtained.
