# Climate Refugee 

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Social Sciences, Humanities, or Environmental Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about topics such as Social and Environmental Policy, Climate Change and Human Migration, Climate Refugees/Environmental Migrants, and Climate Justice.

This lesson plan enables students to learn about human migration caused by climate change, and the term 'Climate Refugees' and its growing significance. The activity provides insights into geographic locations whose existence is threatened by climate change, and communities that are fleeing their homes, resulting in large-scale migration.
Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Social Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High School, undergraduate  
__Discipline__:  Social Sciences, Humanities, Environmental Sciences  
__Topics__:   Climate Change and Human Migration, Climate Refugees, Climate Justice   
__Climate Topic__: Policies, Politics, and Environmental Governance; Climate Refugees; Climate Justice  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  


### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* identify climate change-related threats to the existence of some regions in the world
* describe the problem of environmental migration and the term, 'Climate Refugee'
* discuss the challenges faced by climate refugees
* enumerate the problems caused by large-scale human migration
* propose policies to handle the challenges posed by climate change-related migration

## Environmental Migration and Climate Refugees
> section: Reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 20 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Introduce the topic of refugees and human migration.
* Introduce and discuss the terms, 'environmental migration' and 'climate refugees'.
:::


* Go through a reading that discusses climate change-related human migration and the term 'climate refugees' by describing how climate change is accelerating migration from various parts of Bangladesh to the capital, Dhaka.
* Discuss the reasons for climate change-related human displacement and the impending climate-refugee crisis by reading an article from The Guardian,

::: column.grow
* This article will help you provide an actual example of the climate-refugee crisis by describing how climate change in Bangladesh is causing large-scale migration of residents from different parts of the country to the capital, Dhaka. Students can also learn about how cities such as Dhaka may struggle to support the large number of incoming environmental migrants.

## Storymap - Climate Migrants
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: Classroom activity
> duration: 90 min

::: .teaching-notes
Conduct a hands-on activity with the help of a storymap and an associated worksheet to help students  to learn about countries and cities that are becoming uninhabitable because of the effects of climate change, and communities that are being forced to leave their homes and migrate to new locations.
Facilitate a detailed exploration and discussion of the responses to the questions in the worksheet, with the help of the storymap tool.
:::

* Now, explore the topic in more detail through mapmaking and visualization techniques by using the storymap tool, 'Climate Migrants', and an associated activity worksheet, 'Climate Migrants'.
* In this activity, you will learn about several regions and communities affected by climate change. Students will understand and discuss the various climate change-related problems such as inundation, erosion, drought and desertification, conflict, and the strain on resources caused by the resulting human migration.
* A wide range of geographic locations including Alaska, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, and Syria are provided as examples.
