# Phenology in Plants

## Overview
> section: overview

This lesson plan allows students to to understand phenology and phenological events in plants and animals. Further, the activities help students to determine the possible relationship between climate and phenological events such as leaf-out in plants. The exercises stimulate thinking about the possible impact of climate change on these periodic life-cycle events.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in the Biological Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High school, Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Biological Sciences  
__Topics__: Phenology in Plants, Phenological Events in Plants, Life-cycle Events in Plants, Leaf-out in Plants  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Biosphere  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* define phenology
* enumerate various phenological events in plants and animals
* analyze data on life-cycle events in plants
* interpret data on life-cycle events in plants
* discuss the possible link between climate and phenological events in plants
* discuss the potential impact of climate change on periodic life-cycle events in plants

## Introduction to Phenology
> section: intro
> format: Reading
> duration: 20-30 min

::: .teaching-notes

Introduce the topic with the help of a reading

* Introduce the topic of phenology, its significance, and the link between plant phenology and climate by using the reading, [About Phenology](http://budburst.org/phenology-defined) from Budburst, a project of Chicago Botanic Garden.
* Discuss a few phenological events (periodic life-cycle events) in plants and animals.

:::
Explore what is phenology, its significance, and the link between plant phenology and climate. Discuss phenological events in your locality.

> duration: 60-90 min

::: .teaching-notes
Explore the topic further by conducting a hands-on activity, [The Timing of Red Maple Leaf-out](https://extension.umaine.edu/signs-of-the-seasons/resources-for-educators/red-maple-leaf-out/), from Signs of the Seasons: A New England Phenology Program, the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. 
:::

Create and analyze graphs by using data for the timing of red maple leaf-out in New England.
