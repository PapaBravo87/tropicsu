# Planck's Law and Blackbody Radiation

## Overview
> section: overview

This lesson allows students to visualize the emission spectra associated with particular temperatures, to understand how Planck’s Law can be used to plot blackbody curves of objects with different temperatures, and to learn the relationship between temperature and peak wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. The activity also introduces the topic of planetary temperatures of objects in the solar system and shows the greenhouse effect of Earth’s atmosphere.
Thus, the use of this toolkit allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Physics.

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* apply Planck’s Law to plot the blackbody curve of an object at a specific temperature
* apply the Stefan-Boltzmann Law to determine the surface temperature of a blackbody
* calculate the surface temperature of the Earth based on the solar energy flux
* explain the effect of the greenhouse effect of the Earth’s atmosphere on the surface temperature of the Earth

::: .teaching-notes
 * Discuss the concept of electromagnetic radiation and blackbody.
 * Proceed with your existing lesson plan to explain Planck’s Law.

:::

The spectral composition of a heated body depends on the materials of which the body consists.That is not the case for an ideal radiator or absorber. 
Such an ideal object absorbs and thus emits radiation of all frequencies equally and fully. 
A radiator/absorber of this kind is called a blackbody, and its radiation spectrum is referred to as blackbody radiation, which depends on only one parameter, its temperature. 
Scientists devise and study such ideal objects because their properties can be known exactly. This information can then be used to determine and understand why real objects, such as a piece of iron or glass, a cloud, or a star, behave differently.

::: column.grow
Planck’s radiation law, a mathematical relationship formulated in 1900 by German physicist Max Planck to explain the spectral-energy distribution of radiation emitted by a blackbody (a hypothetical body that completely absorbs all radiant energy falling upon it, reaches some equilibrium temperature, and then reemits that energy as quickly as it absorbs it). 

Planck assumed that the sources of radiation are atoms in a state of oscillation and that the vibrational energy of each oscillator may have any of a series of discrete values but never any value between. Planck further assumed that when an oscillator changes from a state of energy E1 to a state of lower energy E2, the discrete amount of energy E1 − E2, or quantum of radiation, is equal to the product of the frequency of the radiation, symbolized by the Greek letter ν and a constant h, now called Planck’s constant, that he determined from blackbody radiation data; i.e., E1 − E2 = hν.

::: column.grow
All objects with a temperature above absolute zero (0 K, -273.15 oC) emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.
A blackbody is a theoretical or model body which absorbs all radiation falling on it, reflecting or transmitting none. It is a hypothetical object which is a “perfect” absorber and a “perfect” emitter of radiation over all wavelengths.
The spectral distribution of the thermal energy radiated by a blackbody (i.e. the pattern of the intensity of the radiation over a range of wavelengths or frequencies) depends only on its temperature.

::: column.grow
The characteristics of blackbody radiation can be described in terms of several laws:
 * Planck’s Law of blackbody radiation, a formula to determine the spectral energy density of the emission at each wavelength (Eλ) at a particular absolute temperature (T).

::: column.grow
 * Wien’s Displacement Law, which states that the frequency of the peak of the emission (fmax) increases linearly with absolute temperature (T). Conversely, as the temperature of the body increases, the wavelength at the emission peak decreases.

Solve following activity to understand how Planck’s Law can be used to plot blackbody curves of objects with different temperatures, and the relationship between temperature and peak wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.
As the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to lower intensities and longer wavelengths.
