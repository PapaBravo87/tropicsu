## Overview
> section: overview

::: .teaching-notes
Enroll in the following courses before starting the lesson plan:-
* [Business Applications of Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Interval Estimation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hypothesis-testing-confidence-intervals)
* [Inferential Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro)

### Hurricane Analysis

This lesson plan allows your students to perform statistical analysis and interpretation of data *(specifically, analyzing trends and determining uncertainty)* by using hurricane data records.

:::

In the activity, students will explore possible trends in hurricane intensity and number over the past 40 years, and will investigate a possible link between climate change and hurricane strength.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Statistics, Geography, or Earth Sciences.


__Grade Level__: Undergraduate  

__Discipline__: Statistics, Geography, Earth Sciences

__Topics__: 
* Statistics: Inferential Statistics, Trend Analysis, Uncertainty, Confidence Interval, Student’s t-Distribution
* Geography, Earth Sciences : Disasters, Hazards, Hurricanes, Storms, Oceanography, Trends in Hurricane Intensity  

__Climate Topic__: Disasters and Hazards

__Location__: Global (data in the activity is for the Atlantic Ocean)  

__Languages__: English  

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

*  calculate trends in data
*  determine uncertainty and evaluate confidence in trends using Student's t-distribution
*  discuss the possible impacts of climate change on the intensity and number of hurricanes

## Confidence Intervals
> section: intro
> format: Video
> duration: 9 min

::: .teaching-notes
A micro-lecture (video) that introduces the topic of confidence interval.
:::

* Introduce the topic of trends and confidence intervals.

Play this [micro-lecture video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hypothesis-testing-confidence-intervals/lecture/cpecc/introducing-confidence-interval) (approx. 9 min), Introducing Confidence Interval from this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hypothesis-testing-confidence-intervals/lecture/cpecc/introducing-confidence-interval) , from [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
    
Alternatively, you can watch the video below to explain confidence intervals.

## Trends In Hurricanes Instensity
> section: activity1
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
A classroom/laboratory activity to calculate trends and uncertainties in hurricane intensity by analyzing hurricane data records over 40 years.
:::

* Next, explore the topics in more detail through a hands-on classroom/laboratory activity, [Is There a Trend in Hurricane Intensity?](https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/hurricanes/activities/28276.html)  
* This activity will help your students determine trends, uncertainties, and confidence intervals by analyzing actual hurricane data records for the Atlantic Ocean over a period of 40 years. They will also discuss the potential link between climate change and hurricane intensity.
* Download the documents (teaching material and tips) for the activity from [here](https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/hurricanes/activities/28276.html).
*  Conduct the activities and assignments described in the teaching material (analysis and interpretation of actual data by using MS Excel).

Use this lesson plan to help your students find answers to:

 1.  Is there an increase in the frequency of major hurricanes over the past few decades?
 2.  Calculate the trend and determine the confidence interval for the frequency of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean from past records.
 3.  Calculate the trend and evaluate the uncertainty for the intensity of hurricanes.
 4.  What are the possible effects of climate change on the intensity and number of tropical cyclones/hurricanes?
