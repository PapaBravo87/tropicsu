## Introduction to Calculus

[Polynomials](gloss:polynomial) are some of the simplest [functions](gloss:function)
we use. We can compute [derivatives](gloss:derivative) of polynomials easily with
some basic rules. Besides, many relations in the real world can be modeled as
polynomial functions.

On this lesson we will first learn how to calculate derivatives of polynomials.
Then, we will use a model of the concentration of `CO_2` in the atmosphere where
it follows a polynomial function of the time. Using derivatives, we will study
the predictions of this model for the future.

Some examples of polynomials:

::: column(width=320, align=center)

    x-coordinate-system(width=320 height=320 x-axis="-4|3|1")

{.caption} `1/3 x^3 + x^2 - 2x - 3`

::: column(width=320)

    x-coordinate-system(width=320 height=320 x-axis="-4|3|1")

{.caption} `x^2 + 2x - 2`

## Mauna Loa Observatory
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 60 min

::: .teaching-notes
Help your students apply the learned concepts through a classroom activity. This
activity uses atmospheric `CO_2` data from the Mauna Loa Observatory for the period 1950 to 2017.

This activity will help students to
* observe the trend in increasing atmospheric `CO_2` levels.
* infer the approximate year when atmospheric `CO_2` levels could cause global
  temperatures to increase by 2°C (leading to serious climate change-related
  problems).
* determine the desired trends in atmospheric `CO_2` levels that could help in
  avoiding or mitigating such climate change-related consequences.

On the worksheet, do exercises 1-6 to predict atmospheric `CO_2` levels in the
future. Discuss the possible impact of these trends on global temperature and
climate. You can expand this activity to introduce the concept of curve fitting.

::: column.grow
The [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/), in the
Pacific islands of Hawaii (USA), is a research facility that monitors and
collects data on the atmosphere since the 1950s.

Here we will use some data on the concentration of carbon dioxide (`CO_2`) on
the atmosphere. The observatory records values of the concentration regularly
for long periods of time (years), so we end up with a collection of points
(time, concentration).

Using a technique called _curve fitting_, we can find the polynomial function
that best describes the relation between the two variables, by passing the
closest possible to all the points. 

Once we have a mathematical description of the physical measures, we can use
mathematical tools (such as the derivatives) to analyze and extract information
from the data.
