# Hydrocarbons and Climate Change

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school Chemistry teacher, this set of computer-based tools will help you to introduce the topics of hydrocarbons in fossil fuels, carbon dioxide release by fossil fuel combustion and the effect of high atmospheric carbon dioxide on climate change.
This lesson plan helps students to learn about hydrocarbons, different types of hydrocarbons, and how the products of their combustion reactions can potentially lead to climate change. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.

__Grade Level__: High School    
__Discipline__: Chemistry, Environmental Sciences  
__Topics__: Chemistry: Fossil fuels, Hydrocarbons, Combustion reactions; Environmental Sciences: Carbon dioxide and global warming  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Atmosphere, Climate and the anthroposphere, Energy sources and Climate change  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)  
__Duration__: 50-60 min  

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* Learn that fossil fuels are primarily composed of hydrocarbons.
* Compare the products of combustion of various hydrocarbons.
* Explore the thermal properties of carbon dioxide and air.
* Interpret how the combustion of fossil fuels may release greenhouse gases such as CO2 in the atmosphere and may potentially contribute to global warming.

## Introdcution to Fossil Fuels
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 4 min

::: .teaching-notes
Introduce the topic by playing the video micro-lecture, 'What's the deal With Fossil Fuels' from California Academy of Sciences.
Emphasize how carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel combustion may lead to global warming.
:::

Use the following video that introduces the topic of fossil fuels, how they are formed, and how the combustion/burning of fossil fuels may lead to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and potentially contribute to global warming.
You may use this teaching tool to discuss common fossil fuels and their formation, and renewable and non-renewable sources of energy.

## Hydrocarbon Combustion
> section: reading
> id: reding
> format: Reading
> duration: 15 min


::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading that describes hydrocarbons as primary components of fossil fuels, types of hydrocarbons and their structures, and the products of combustion of different hydrocarbons.
You may demonstrate the products of the combustion by having your students note how much CO2 per molecule is released due to the combustion of different fossil fuels.

:::

::: column.grow
* Explore the topic in greater detail through this reading titled "Hydrocarbon Combustion".
* Use this tool to demonstrate the products of the combustion of different hydrocarbons and to explore the potential costs and benefits of using different fossil fuels.
* Investigate how much CO2 per molecule is released due to the combustion of different fossil fuels.

## The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: Activity
> duration: 40 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a classroom/laboratory activity that demonstrates the thermal properties of CO2, its role as a greenhouse gas, and how increased CO2 concentrations due to combustion of different hydrocarbons in fossil fuels may contribute to global warming. Ask your students if their observations of the thermal properties of CO2 and air allow them to better understand the relationship between increased atmospheric CO2 due to combustion of fossil fuels and an increase in Earth's surface temperature since the industrial revolution.

:::

::: column.grow
* Investigate the thermal properties of CO2, its role as a greenhouse gas, and how increased CO2 concentrations due to combustion of different hydrocarbons in fossil fuels may contribute to global warming.
* Use the classroom/laboratory activity titled "The carbon dioxide greenhouse - is it effective?" and proceed with the lab activity as instructed.
* Observe the effect of applying heat and light energy on carbon dioxide and air.

::: column.grow

* Check if observations of the thermal properties of CO2 and air allow you to better understand the relationship between increased atmospheric CO2 due to combustion of fossil fuels and an increase in Earth's surface temperature since the industrial revolution.
* You may further explore impacts of climate change on local and global scales and on different sectors.
