# Fertilizers and Climate

## Overview
> section: overview

As an undergraduate-level Chemistry teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about fertilizers, types of fertilizers, the assessment of different types of fertilizers, the possible effect of fertilizer use on the environment due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and best practices to mitigate these effects.

The teaching tools in this lesson plan help students to understand the significance of GHG emissions from fertilizer use. Further, the lesson plan triggers a discussion on practices to mitigate such emissions because GHGs are possible contributors to climate change. Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.

## Introduction to Fertilizers
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 11 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Play the micro-lecture [Introduction to Fertilizer](https://ifdc.org/2013/03/15/introduction-to-fertilizer/), delivered by Dr. John Shields, 
* Discuss how excess nutrients added to the soil are harmful to the environment.
* Finally, discuss the need for using fertilizers in agriculture to feed the increasing global population.

:::

What are fertilizers and why are they used in agriculture? 
Watch the following video to know about fertilizers, types of fertilizers, their compositions and their relative advantages and disadvantages.

## Nitrogen cycle in agricultural practices 
> section: Diagram
> id: diagram
> format: Diagram
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Explain the nitrogen cycle (with reference to agricultural practices) and supplement by using the simplified diagram suggested below.
* Discuss how nitrogen fixation in the soil occurs through natural processes and how it can be carried out artificially through the usage of fertilizers.
* Discuss the role of microbes in the nitrogen cycle.
* Discuss the resultant emission of a GHG nitrous oxide (N20) by the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers.
:::

* Explore the nitrogen cycle (with reference to agricultural practices) and supplement by using this simplified diagram “N Cycle”. 
* Microbes play an important role in natural nitrogen fixation in the soil. The process of nitrogen fixation in the soil can be carried out artificially through the usage of fertilizers.
* The bacterial actions on N fertilizers added to the soil can cause the emission of nitrous oxide (N20) to the atmosphere.

## Global warming potential of greenhouse gases
> section: Visualization
> id: visualization
> format: Visualization
> duration: 50 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use the visualization and associated data set to explain the global warming potential of greenhouse gases, specifically of N20, relative to that of carbon dioxide
* Discuss the possible impact of N2O emissions from fertilizers on climate.
:::

* Use the visualization and associated data set “Global warming potential of greenhouse gases over 100-year timescale” to explore the global warming potential (GWP), over a 100-year time-scale, of one-unit masses of various GHGs, and specifically of N20, relative to that of carbon dioxide.
* With a much higher GWP than carbon dioxide per unit mass, the possible impact of N2O emissions from fertilizers on climate is more potent than that of carbon dioxide.
* Discuss why a small change in N2O emissions could have a significant impact on global warming.

## Relationship between fertilzers, plant growth and N2O
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 5 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Play the video “  for an overview of the need to use fertilizers in agriculture and best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate the adverse effects of fertilizer use on global warming.
:::

Watch the following video that briefly explains how fertilizers affect plant growth and how a GHG N2O is released to the atmosphere due to soil bacterial action on N fertilizers. Best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate these adverse effects of fertilizer use are also introduced here.

::: .teaching-notes
If you or your students would like to explore the topic further, these additional resources will be useful.
:::

1. A reading, [Fertilizers and their use](http://utbfc.utk.edu/Content%20Folders/Forages/Fertilization/Publications/PB1637.pdf) that describes, in detail, the different types of fertilizers and their usage.

2. A visualization, [GHG emissions across sectors](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#emissions-by-sector) that allows students to explore data of GHG emissions across different sectors, thereby providing insights on the GHGs that are particularly significant in agriculture.

3. A reading, [Agriculture and climate change](https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/environment/climate-change/agriculture-and-climate-change.html) that describes the impact of agriculture on climate change in Manitoba, Canada, by using a study spanning 25 years.
