# Black Carbon And Climate

## Overview
> section: overview

As a High School or Undergraduate Chemistry or Environmental Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about allotropy, various allotropes of carbon and their structural and physical properties, black carbon, sources of black carbon and its impact on Earth’s climate.

This lesson plan will help students understand the concept of allotropy and various allotropes of carbons. Students will learn about black carbon, the effect of black carbon on the Earth’s albedo and therefore, its impact on the climate.

Also this lesson plan will also help students to understand how the immediate effect of controlling black carbon emission can potentially slow down the rate of global warming.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry or Environmental Sciences.

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* define allotropy and describe some allotropes of carbon and their structural properties
* explain what black carbon is and elaborate on its sources
* describe how black carbon affects clouds and cloud formation
* explain the mechanisms of the cooling or heating of the Earth’s atmosphere due to black carbon

## Black Carbon
> section: video
> id: Video
> format: Video
> duration: 6 min

::: .teaching-notes
A video that introduces black carbon, an allotrope of carbon and describes its impact on health and climate.
:::

* Use the video below to introduce the topic of black carbon, an allotrope of carbon and describe its sources.
* Also describe its impact on health and climate. 
* Explain using the video, how black carbon contributes to global warming by altering the albedo of clouds and land and ice surfaces.
* Discuss how cutting down black carbon emissions can have an immediate impact on the greenhouse effect caused by it.

## The Albedo effect
> section: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes

A reading that describes the albedo effect of black carbon and how it affects the nature and formation of clouds, resulting in both, a warming and cooling effect on the Earth’s surface.

:::

### Reading: Black Carbon and Warming: It’s Worse than We Thought

* Use the feature article, ‘Black Carbon and Warming: It’s Worse than We Thought’, by Carl Zimmer in YaleEnvironment360, published by the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, to discuss a report that suggests that black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide in its heat trapping power.

* Use the reading to explain to your students, the various ways in which clouds are affected by soot or black carbon.

* Discuss how the albedo effect of black carbon, especially in clouds, affects Earth’s atmosphere as well as its surface temperatures.

* Emphasize how black carbon deposition is speeding up the melting of Himalayan Glaciers.

* Finally, explain why a reduction in black carbon emissions could cause an immediate slowdown of the planet’s warming.

## Black Carbon In Real World
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> id: activity
> duration: 90 – 120 min

::: .teaching-notes

* For high school students:
  * Use **Activity : Changing Planet: Black Carbon- A Dusty Situation**, a laboratory activity to demonstrate the effect of black carbon on surface temperatures.

* For undergraduates:
  * Use **Activity : Energy and the Poor- Black Carbon in the Developing Nations**, a classroom activity to discuss the implications of black carbon emissions on health and climate.

:::

### Activity : Changing Planet: Black Carbon- A Dusty Situation

* Use this inquiry-based hands on laboratory activity, ‘Changing Planet: Black Carbon- A Dusty Situation’, adapted by Missy Holzer, Jennifer Bergman, and Roberta Johnson of the NESTA/Windows to the Universe team, to help the students to understand the albedo effect of black carbon.

* Follow the instructions to obtain data for the surface heat absorption capacity of varying concentrations of black carbon on paper.
Materials for set-up including students’ worksheets are listed in the right-hand column of the summary table.
* Use the graphed data to discuss with your students the influence of black carbon on the heat absorption ability of the Earth’s surface.
* Discuss how cutting down of black carbon emissions can reduce global surface temperatures.

### Activity : Energy and the Poor- Black Carbon in the Developing Nations

* Use this group activity, ‘Energy and the Poor- Black Carbon in the Developing Nations’, by Science Education Research Center at Carleton College (SERC Carleton), to discuss how the burning of fossil fuels and biomass-based fuels results in black carbon emissions in developing countries.
* Use this activity to enable students to ‘critically evaluate the impacts of varied household energy sources, synthesize a wide range of social, health and environmental impacts and generate solutions to these problems’.
* The plan includes downloadable notes for students and teachers with suggested points for discussion.
* Use the activity plan to direct a ‘jigsaw’-method of discussion where individuals within groups research and summarize their findings on varied selected topics related to black carbon, its impacts, and solutions and then re-group to summarize their findings in a ‘concept-map’ to represent all the aspects of discussion.
