# Isotopic Compositions

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate teacher of Chemistry or Earth Sciences, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching atomic number, mass number, isotopes and isotopic ratios, the use of isotopic ratios to calculate temperature, and the use of isotopic composition to recreate past temperatures and climate.
This lesson plan allows students to understand isotopes, isotopic ratios, the relationship between isotopic compositions and temperature, and how isotopic compositions are used to recreate past temperature and climate.
Thus, the use of this Lesson Plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry or Earth Sciences.


__Grade Level__: High school, Undergraduate     
__Discipline__: Chemistry, Earth Sciences  
__Topics__: Atomic Number, Mass Number, Isotopes, Isotopic Ratios and Compositions  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Cryosphere, Climate Variability Record  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English (Simulation tool available in multiple languages)  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)  
__Duration__: 120 min  


### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:
* define isotopes and list examples of isotopes
* describe how isotopic ratios can be used to infer temperature
* explain how past temperatures and climate can be determined by analyzing ice-core isotope data
* understand natural variability of Earth's climate and climate change due to anthropogenic cause

## Introdcution to atomic number, mass number and isotopes
> section: intro
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a video micro-lecture that introduces the concepts of atomic number, mass number, and isotopes.
:::

* Revise the components of an atom.
* Play the micro-lecture (video), "Atomic number, mass number, and isotopes", that introduces the concepts of atomic number, mass number, and isotopes. 
* The video will help you to understand the definitions of the terms through examples of hydrogen, carbon, and uranium isotopes.

::: column.grow
* For a more detailed exploration of isotopes, atomic mass, and methods to calculate the average atomic mass, you may use the PhET simulation tool and associated activity listed in the Additional Resources section of this lesson plan. 
* This activity will help to calculate the average atomic mass of sample mixtures of isotopes by using various methods.

## Isotope anlysis
> section: reading
> id: reding
> format: Reading
> duration: 20 min


::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading that describes isotopic ratios, the relationship between isotopic compositions and temperature, and how isotopic compositions are used to recreate past temperature and climate.

:::

::: column.grow
* Next, read "Isotope Analysis" from Harvard University to get introduced to the occurrence and distribution of oxygen isotopes.
* Further, this reading will help the you to understand isotopic ratios, the relationship between isotopic compositions and temperature, and how scientists can use isotopic compositions to recreate past temperature and climate.

## Relationship between isotopic compositions and climate
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: Activity
> duration: 90 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a classroom/laboratory activity that demonstrates the recreation of the climate of the last 500,000 years approximately using oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of ice cores from Antarctica.

:::
::: column.grow
* Now, explore the relationship between isotopic compositions and climate through a hands-on classroom/laboratory activity, "From Isotopes to Temperature".
* In this activity, your can analyze isotopic compositions of ice core data from Antarctica to infer past temperatures and climate.
