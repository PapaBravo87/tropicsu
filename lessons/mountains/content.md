# Mountains and Climate


## Overview
> section: overview

As a High School or Undergraduate Geography or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach about mountains that comprise one of Earth's major landforms and the factors that affect their climate. This lesson plan will teach your students about geomorphic characteristics of mountains, orogeny- formation of mountains through tectonic processes in the Earth's crust and enable them to describe different types of mountains (such as fold and fault-block mountains) and major mountain systems of the world.
This lesson plan also includes a resource to explain how global climatic factors affect mountains and how mountains in turn, affect regional climate.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Geography or Earth Sciences.


__Grade Level__: High School, Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Geography, Earth Sciences  
__Topics__: Orogeny, Tectonic Processes, Fold Mountains, Fault-Block Mountains, Volcanism, Crustal Shortening, Heating and Thermal Expansion, Alpine-Type Mountain Belts, Andean-Type Mountain Belts, Intracontinental Mountain Belts, Climate Factors- Latitude, Elevation and Continentality  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Lithosphere  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online  
__Duration__: 50-60 min  

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* explain orogeny and the orogenic processes
* describe different types of mountains and major mountain systems of the world
* understand the factors determining mountain climate
* discuss how mountains affect regional climate

## Introduction to Mountain Structures
> section: intro
> id: reading1
> format: Reading
> duration: 25 min

::: .teaching-notes
 * Use a reading that introduces mountains and explains how they are formed or destroyed. It also describes different mountain types and various mountain systems of the world. 
 * Describe different types of mountains such as fold and fault-block mountains giving suitable examples and explain the processes involved in their formation. 
:::

* Mountain is a landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes, a relatively confined summit area, and considerable local relief.
* Use the reading, 'Mountain- Landform' to get introduced to the topic of mountains and their geomorphic characteristics.

  * Use the text to explore the tectonic processes that are involved in the formation and degradation of mountain belts.

## Investigate mountains and their role in climate
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 24 min

::: .teaching-notes
 * Play the video lecture to develop the topic of mountains further by describing their role in climate.
 * This video explains how global climatic factors affect mountain climate and how mountains in turn, influence the local climate.
:::

 
::: column.grow
 * Use a video lecture, "Global Climate Drivers" by Coursera to get introduced to the role of mountains in global climatic conditions.
 * With the help of this video, first, explore various global climate drivers such as the Hadley Cells and the Coriolis Force that can cause imbalances in temperature, wind and precipitation on the Earth's surface.

::: column.grow
 * Then using the lecture and the quoted examples, extend your understanding about how factors such as latitude, elevation and continentality of mountains influence the climate of different regions across the globe.
 * Discuss how these factors affect mountain climate and in turn, how regional or local climates are affected by mountain belts.

## Mountains and Climate Change
> id: reading2
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading to describe the effect of climate change on mountains.
:::

::: column.grow
  * Use the reading, "Mountains and Climate Change- From Understanding to Action", pages 68-70, to understand the global geo-physical, biological and socio- economic effects of climate change on mountains.

## Questions and Assignments
> section: questions

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

* What is orogeny? Where are most orogenic belts located?
* Compare and contrast between fold and fault-block mountains.
* How do global climatic factors affect mountain climate and how do mountains in turn, affect regional climate?

---

## Additional resources
> section: resources

If you or your students would like to explore the topic further, these additional resources will be useful.

* A reading that describes fold mountains and includes an [embedded video](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fold-mountain/) that shows how fold mountains are formed due to tectonic forces.

* A [song-based video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy3ORIgyXyk&feature=youtu.be) that describes fold mountains and their characteristics.

* A [short film](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/video/shorts/367324227714/) that shows the life cycle of mountains.
