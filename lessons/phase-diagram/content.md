# Phase Diagrams and Phase Equilibria

## Overview
> section: overview

As an undergraduate Chemistry, Physics, or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach phase diagrams and phase equilibria.
Phase diagrams can be used to understand the stability of different phases of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) under changing temperature and pressure. This lesson plan will help students learn about phase equilibria through the example of the phase diagram of water. Students will learn about the phases of water on Earth, Mars, and Venus and will discuss the role of the water cycle in making the climate of planet Earth habitable.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry, Physics, or Earth Sciences.

__Grade Level__: Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Physics  
__Topics__: Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams of Water, Triple and Critical Points in a Phase Diagram, Degrees of Freedom, Feedback Mechanisms, Vapour Pressure, Runaway Greenhouse Effect  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Atmosphere, The Greenhouse Effect  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Duration__: 45-60 min  

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe a one-component phase diagram
* explain various regions and points (such as the triple point, the critical point) in a phase diagram
* define a supercritical fluid
* compare the climates of Earth, Venus, and Mars with the help of the phase diagram of water
* use the phase diagram to explain the water vapor feedback mechanism in the Earth's atmosphere and its role in making the planet habitable.

> format: Video
> duration: 12 min

::: .teaching-notes
 * Introduce the topic of phase diagrams withthe help of this video.
 * Use the tool to first describe the phase diagram of water, and phase transformations of water at melting and boiling points, at various atmospheric pressures.
 * Describe the phase diagram for carbon dioxide. Further, use the tool to explain the triple and critical points in a phase diagram and discuss the phase transitions at these points.
 * Finally, introduce the term "supercritical fluid" and briefly describe its properties.

:::

* Play the video micro-lecture "Phase Diagrams" by Khan Academy, which
 -  introduces the topic of phase diagrams
 -  explains what phase diagrams depict by describing their different regions and degrees of freedom
 -  describes how to interpret phase diagrams under varying conditions of temperature and pressure

* Use this video that describes the phase diagram of water, and phase transformations of water at melting and boiling points, at various atmospheric pressures.
* Then explore the phase diagram for carbon dioxide.

## Phase Diagrams in Details
> section: reading 
> id: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
 Use a reading that describes a typical phase diagram and its components, discusses the phase diagrams of water and carbon dioxide, and provides examples and exercises based on these phase diagrams.

:::

::: column.grow
 * With the help of the reading in the chapter "12.4. Phase Diagrams" (by LibreTextsTM), explore what is a typical phase diagram.
 * Further explore the different regions of a phase diagram where the various phases of a single substance exist in a stable state and the points at which phase transitions take place.
 * Discuss the triple and critical points in a phase diagram and the stability of phases at these points.

 * Further, examine the phase diagrams of water and carbon dioxide, and discuss specific temperature and pressure conditions at which the different phases of these substances are stable/unstable.
 * Use example 12.4.1 and exercise 12.4.2 included in the text to understand phase transitions of water.
 * Use this reading to also knwo more about supercritical fluids, their properties and their commercial applications as solvents.

## Water Vepur feedback and Planetary Atmosphere
> section: video2
> id: video2
> format: video
> duration: 22-25 min

::: .teaching-notes
 * Use a video micro-lecture and an associated reading that describe the phase diagrams of water on Earth, Mars, and Venus. They also discuss the water vapor feedback mechanism in the atmospheres of these planets and the role of this mechanism in the greenhouse effect. 
 * Further, use these resources that explain why the climate of Earth is habitable while that of Mars and Venus is not.
:::

 
::: column.grow
 * Play the video micro-lecture "Water Vapor Feedback" by Prof. David Archer, the University of Chicago, that explains the stable phases of water at various temperatures on Earth.
 * It also explains the concept of water vapor feedback and the greenhouse effect of water vapor on Earth's atmosphere by using the phase diagram of water. 
 * Further, compare the effect of water vapor feedback on the atmospheres of Earth, Mars, and Venus. Discuss how the water cycle ensures that Earth has a climate that is more suitable to support life.
