# Biodiversity

## Overview
> section: overview

As an undergraduate Biological Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you n teaching evolution and behavior, biodiversity, and ecology.
This lesson plan helps students to learn about the current and past habitats of an animal (specifically, squirrels), and how changing habitats can affect the distribution of a species. The activity will also allow learners to examine data and interpret whether climate change can cause changes in habitats and consequently, changes in species distribution.
Thus, the use of this toolkit allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in the Biological Sciences.

__Grade Level__: Undergraduate
__Discipline__: Biological Sciences
__Topics__: 
* Biodiversity, Animal Diversity (Chordates, Mammals)
* Evolution and Behavior (Species and Speciation)
* Ecology (Populations; Precipitation Patterns, Vegetation,
Soil Types; Zoogeography)
__Climate Topic__: Climate and theBiosphere
__Location__: USA  
__Languages__: English
__Duration__: 120-150 min

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* categorize species by family and by habitat
* compare and analyze past and modern data on species distribution and habitat
* interpret the effect of climate change on changes in species distribution and habitat
* explain how the monitoring of some species can serve as an indicator of the effect of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems

## The American Pika
> section: video
> id: Video
> format: Video
> duration: 5 min

::: .teaching-notes
A video that explains how the monitoring of a climate-sensitive species, the American Pika, can reveal the possible impact of climate change on the habitat and population of a species.
:::

* Play the short video (approx. 5 min), “The American Pika: A climate indicator species?”. 

* In this video, Chris Ray from the University of Colorado Boulder talks about her research on the American Pika, a species that is sensitive to climate change. 

* The monitoring of pikas could serve as an indicator of the effect of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems.

## What do Squirrels know about Climate Change?
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> id: activity
> duration: 90 – 120 min

::: .teaching-notes
A classroom/laboratory activity to examine and analyze squirrel species distribution and habitat data (from the USA) over time,and to interpret the possible relationship between climate change and biodiversity.
:::

* Now, explore this topic in an interactive and engaging manner through a classroom/laboratory activity, **What do Squirrels know about Climate Change?**, contributed by Beth Norman, Allan Ashworth, and Russell W. Graham, available on the SERC Carleton website.

* This activity will help your students analyze data for past and modern squirrel populations and habitats. They will then determine how climate change may affect habitat changes and species distribution. Students will use actual data from some states in the USA to perform data analysis and interpretation.

* Conduct the activities described in Part 1 and Part 2.

## Questions and Assignments
> section: questions

Use the tools and the concepts learned so far to discuss and determine answers to the following questions:

*  What are the factors that influence the distribution of a species?
* How does climate impact biodiversity?
* What is range shift? Examine global databases to find out examples of climate-related range shifts.
