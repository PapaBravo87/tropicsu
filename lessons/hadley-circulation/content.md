# Hadley Circulation and Heat Transport

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Geography, Earth Sciences, or Physics teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about heat transport in the atmosphere, atmospheric circulation, and the Hadley Cell and Hadley Circulation.
Geography/Earth Sciences: The lesson plan also helps students to understand the effects of Hadley Circulation on global precipitation patterns, the geographical distribution of deserts, and trade winds.
Physics: The lesson plan also helps students to apply the law of conservation of angular momentum and understand the concept of a thermally direct cell.
Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Geography, Earth Sciences, or Physics.

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* describe the Hadley Cell and Hadley Circulation (atmospheric circulation and heat transport)
* explain the influence of the Hadley Circulation on the geographical distribution of deserts and global precipitation patterns
* discuss the potential impact of climate change on Hadley Circulation
* discuss the possible effects of Hadley Cell expansion

## Introduction to atmospheric Heat Transport and Hadley Cell 
> section: intro
> id: video1
> format: Video
> duration: 7 min

::: .teaching-notes
 Introduce the topic of heat transport in the atmosphere and Hadley Cell by playing the micro-lecture.
:::

George Hadley (1685-1768), was an English physicist and meteorologist who first formulated an accurate theory describing the trade winds and the associated meridional (north-south) circulation pattern now known as the Hadley cell.
Following short video introduces the topics heat transport in the atmosphere and Hadley Cell.

## Hadley Cell and a Simple Atmospheric Circulation Model
> section: reading
> id: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 8 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use a reading that discusses the Hadley Cell in more detail and explains a simple model for the Hadley circulation, using the law of conservation of angular momentum.
:::

::: column.grow  
 * Explore more about the Hadley Cell and a simple atmospheric circulation model by using the reading "Hadley Cells" from Harvard University.
 * The reading applies the law of conservation of angular momentum to explain a simple model for the Hadley cell and also introduces a possible explanation for equable climates in the past (Cretaceous period).

## Relationship between Hadley Cell and Earth's Climate System
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> duration: 40-60 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Explore the topic in a more engaging matter by conducting the following classroom/laboratory activity.
* Help your students to analyze and map real data through the NASA MERRA reanalysis model. 
:::


::: column.grow  
 * Use the classroom/laboratory activity "Hadley Circulation using NASA MERRA Reanalysis Model" to analyze and map real data through the NASA MERRA reanalysis model to understand the actual impact of the Hadley Cell on Earth's climate system (e.g., geographical distribution of deserts, global precipitation patterns, trade winds).
 * Try to visualize 30-year-average data on winds and their vertical velocity to understand the Hadley circulation and its influence on regional climates. 
 * The activity file and the Lab Instructions are available as downloadable file.
