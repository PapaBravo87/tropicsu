# Food Security

## Overview
> section: overview

helps students understand the various aspects of food security, and the challenges faced in food security and agriculture at different locations across the world. The activities explore the two-way relationship between agriculture and climate: the impact of food production on the climate, and the possible effects of climate change on agricultural production through location-specific examples.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Social Sciences or Environmental Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High school  
__Discipline__:	 Social Sciences, Environmental Sciences  
__Topic(s) in Discipline__:	 Food Security, Agriculture, Climate Change and Food Security, Climate and the Food System, Climate Change and Agriculture  
__Climate Topic__ : Climate and Food, Climate Change and Food Security, Climate Change and Agriculture  
__Location__: Global, Africa  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material can be downloaded for offline use)

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

define food security
* identify the climate-related factors that affect food production and crop yield
* discuss how crop production may cause climate change
* discuss how climate change may impact agriculture
* propose actions that may reduce the footprint of the food system on climate change

## Introduction to Food Security
> section: video
> format: Video
> duration: 26 min

::: .teaching-notes

Introduce the topic of food security and discuss the relationship between food production and the climate with the help of following two videos.
:::

* In the first video, the topics of food security, the relationship between food production and the climate are introduced.

## For High school : Our changing climate and greenhouse gases

> section: reading
> format: Reading
> duration: 55 min

::: .teaching-notes

* Download the Lesson Plan, Slides, and Handouts for the students from the source.
* Conduct the activities described in the Lesson Plan.

:::

 *  Go through the Overview [Our Changing Climate Lesson](/resources/food-security/downloads/lesson5-climate-lessonplan.pdf) on how the food system is linked to a global issue: climate change.
 *  Go through the slides of [Our Changing Climate](/resources/food-security/downloads/lesson5-climate-slides.pdf) to get introduced to the concepts of weather vs climate, the greenhouse effect, climate and food systems.
 *  Use the Handout of [Sources of Greenhouse Gases](/resources/food-security/downloads/lesson5-climate-handoutsandguides.pdf) to understand the relationship between the food system and climate change, and to determine actions that can reduce the impact of the food system on climate change.
