# Beer-Lambert Law and Earth’s Atmosphere  

## Overview
> section: overview

As an undergraduate Chemistry teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to teach the Beer-Lambert Law and its application in atmospheric radiation absorption studies.

This lesson plan will enable students to learn about the Beer-Lambert Law and understand its application for studying the molar absorptivity of greenhouse gases.

Thus, the use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.


__Grade Level__: Undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Chemistry    
__Topics__: Beer-Lambert Law, Molar Absorptivity, Absorbance of Incident Light, Transmittance of Incident Light, Intensity of Transmitted Light, Greenhouse Gases, Molar Absorption Coefficient, Molar Extinction Coefficient  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the atmosphere, The Greenhouse Gas Effect    
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  
__Access__: Online (some material may be downloaded for offline use)  
__Duration__: 50-60 min  

### Learning outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* derive the expression for Beer-Lambert Law
* define molar absorptivity/molar absorption coefficient/molar extinction coefficient of a medium
* calculate the effect of concentration of a chemical species and path length on the intensity of transmitted light
* understand the effect of increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases on absorbance of incident sunlight

## Introduction to Beer-Lambert Law
> section: intro
> id: reading1
> format: Reading
> duration: 30 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use a reading that introduces the Beer-Lambert Law and derives the expression for the law. It also includes several examples to show the application of the Beer-Lambert Law for absorbance of transmitted light in medium, under different conditions.

:::

* Use chapter reading, "The Beer-Lambert Law" by LibreTextsTM, that introduces the topic of light transmittance through a medium and Beer-Lambert's Law (or the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law).
* The law is attributed to  Pierre Bouguer, August Beer and Johann Heinrich Lambert.
* Understand how light transmitted through a medium is affected by its concentration. Also, discuss the importance of the path length for light transmittance through a medium.
* Use the reading to derive an expression for the Beer-Lambert's Law.
* Ponder over the non-linear (exponential) relation between transmittance and concentration of medium. Thus, define its molar absorptivity or molar absorption coefficient or molar extinction coefficient (ε).

::: column.grow
* As per the Beer-Lambert's Law, the intensity of light decreases from I0 to I as it passes through a solution of concentration c and length/thickness l.
* Use the examples given in the text, to practice how to use the Beer-Lambert's Law to calculate values for the concentration, pathlength, and molar absorptivity of a given medium.

## Beer-Lambert's Law and Earth’s Atmosphere
> section: reading
> id: reading2
> format: Reading
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use a reading that uses the Beer-Lambert Law to explain the increasing global warming potential of Earth’s atmosphere due to the higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, in recent times.

:::
* Use the reading, "Chemical Connections to Climate Change" to learn  how the Beer-Lambert Law can be used to study the transmittance of sunlight through the atmosphere.
* Discuss the composition of the atmosphere and list out the gases that make up the atmosphere.

::: column.grow

* Extend the understanding of the Beer-Lambert Law to evaluate the absorbance values of individual gases in the atmosphere.
* Use the text to understand the absorption potential of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.
* Discuss how this results in warming on Earth due to the greenhouse effect. Finally, use the reading to explore how this greenhouse gas effect is exacerbated by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

## Simulation, ‘Beer’s Law Lab’
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: Activity
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use a simulation to to allow students to explore the effects of the change in concentration of medium and path length on the absorbance of transmitted light. Encourage the students to note the observations by changing parameters, gather the data and to analyse the data. 
* Initiate an enquiry-based discussion for further understanding of the observed correlations in the parameters.

:::
* Use the simulation, ‘Beer’s Law Lab’ by PhET Interactive Simulations, University of Colorado, to explore the Beer-Lambert’s Law for absorbance/transmittance of incident light through a solution.
* Note the absorbance/transmittance values of incident light when the simulation is run.

::: column.grow
* Try to run the simulation for different solution concentrations, pathlengths and wavelengths of incident light.
* Use the data generated to observe the correlations between these varying parameters (concentration of solution, pathlength and wavelength of incident light) and absorbance/transmittance values.
* Explore more for further understanding of these correlations: eg how much does the absorbance value change when the concentration of a solution is doubled.
