# Chemistry of Carbon Compounds  

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school Chemistry teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching the chemistry of carbon and its compounds, the interaction of greenhouse gas molecules with electromagnetic radiation, and environmental chemistry.

This lesson plan allows students to visualize the molecular structure of atmospheric gases and to understand the effect of electromagnetic radiation on these molecules. The activity will also introduce the topic of greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. Thus, the use of this Lesson Plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry.
This is a step-by-step guide to using this lesson plan in the classroom/laboratory. We have suggested these steps as a possible plan of action. You may customize the lesson plan according to your preferences and requirements.

## Structure of Atmospheric Gases and Common Carbon Comounds 
> section: intro
> id: reading
> format: reading
> duration: 10-15 min

::: .teaching-notes
Introduce the topic through online reading:
* Use a reading that provides an overview of the interaction between infrared radiation and molecules of different atmospheric gases.
* The resoruce is useful to discuss the sources of carbon and its compounds, the molecular structure of some carbon compounds, the phenomenon of greenhouse gases.
:::

::: column.grow
 * Use the reading to know the sources of carbon and its compounds, the molecular structure of some carbon compounds such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).
 * Get introduced to the topic of atmosphere and its composition. The resource introduces the atmospheric gases (including CO2 and CH4) and their typical percentages in the atmosphere.

::: column.grow
 * Read about the phenomenon of sunlight striking the Earth and infrared radiation being emitted from the Earth.
 * This reading material also provides an overview of how CO2 and other atmospheric gas molecules interact with electromagnetic radiation.

## Interaction Between Carbon Molecules and EM Radiations
> section: video
> id: video
> format: video
> duration: 8-9 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a micro-lecture (video) that explains the interaction of molecules such as CO2 and CH4 with electromagnetic radiation, and the resulting molecular vibrations leading to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere.
:::

::: column.grow
 * Extend your understanding of the topic using a micro-lecture (video, approx. 8 min).
 * Use this micro-lecture that explains the interaction of molecules such as CO2 with electromagnetic radiation, and the resulting molecular vibrations that lead to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere.
 * This video is a part of a full lecture, available [here.](http://mindonline.uchicago.edu/media/psd/geophys/PHSC_13400_fall2009/lecture5.mp4)

## Visualize the Greenhouse Effect
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: activity
> duration: 40-50 min

::: .teaching-notes
Conduct an activity using an interactive visualization and associated exercises to explore and analyze how human activities may affect the natural carbon cycle, and to discuss the potential effects on the Earth’s climate.

:::

* Next, take a classroom/laboratory activity “The Greenhouse Effect” to further explore the topic in an interesting manner.
* The tool will help you to visualize the molecular structure of carbon compounds (CO2, CH4), explore the effect of electromagnetic radiation on the molecules, and understand the role of greenhouse gases in climate change.
* Download PhET’s tool, “The Greenhouse Effect”, from the following link. Launch the tool.
* Go to the Photon Absorption pane.
* For each Atmospheric Gas (select options under Atmospheric Gases)—CH4, CO2, H20, N2, O2—observe the molecular structure and the effect of the Infrared Photon on the molecule. The slider on the Light Source can be adjusted to control the rate of emission of photons.

::: column.grow
 * Use the Build Atmosphere option to set the number of molecules of each atmospheric gas. Visualize the effect of the Infrared Photons on the molecules in the atmosphere.
 * The absorption of infrared photons by gases such as CO2 and CH4 in the atmosphere results in the warming of the surface of the planet. This effect is called the greenhouse effect.
 * Go to the Greenhouse Effect pane.
