# The Water Cycle in a Sustainable World 

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or introductory undergraduate Chemistry, Geography or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of tools to teach about the water cycle- its components, the distribution of natural water resources on Earth and the impact of climate change on it.

This lesson plan allows students to learn about the different stages of the water cycle and the factors that influence it. It includes resources that teach students about the different components of the water cycle in detail and how they can be affected by climate change. This lesson plan also enables students to learn about the distribution of water resources under a natural water cycle, how it could be altered due to anthropogenic practices, and what measures could be adopted for a sustainable future.
The use of this lesson plan allows you to integrate the teaching of a climate science topic with a core topic in Chemistry, Geography or Earth Sciences.

__Grade Level__: High school, Undergraduate   
__Discipline__: Chemistry, Geography, Earth Sciences   
__Topics__: Environmental Chemistry, Water Cycle, Biogeochemical Cycles, Hydrologic Cycle, Condensation, Evaporation, Evapotranspiration, Groundwater, Precipitation, Sublimation   
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the Hydrosphere, Climate and the Atmosphere    
__Location__: Global     
__Languages__: English, one resource available in several languages  
__Access__: Online, some resources are available offline    
__Duration__: 60-90 min    

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* learn about the fundamentals of Earth’s natural water cycle
* understand the importance of every component of the natural water cycle
* describe the distribution of the natural water resources on Earth
* discuss the possible impact of climate change on the natural water cycle and distribution of water resources
* explain how anthropogenic activities could affect the natural water cycle

## Introduction to Water Cycle
> section: intro
> format: video
> duration: 8 min

::: .teaching-notes
* With the help of the video, introduce the topic of  natural water cycle on Earth and briefly describes the processes involved in it.
:::

::: column.grow
 * Use the video, ‘Water Cycle’ to get introduced to the processes involved in the water cycle on Earth.
 * The video describes how the water changes through gas-liquid phases and how each phase impacts life on Earth.
 * Explore how the water cycle results in the distribution of saltwater and freshwater resources on Earth.

## More about the Water Cycle
> section: reading1
> format: Reading
> id: reading1
> duration: 40 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Use this reading that describes the different components of the water cycle in detail. It also includes downloadable diagrams of the water cycle with a brief summary of the water cycle in several languages.
* The water cycle diagram and a summary text are available in over 60 different languages.
:::

::: column.grow
 * Use the webpage, ‘The Water Cycle for Adults and Advanced Students’, by the USGS (United States Geological Survey) Water Science School, to explore various aspects of the natural water cycle in detail.
 * Use the tabs in the ‘Overview’ section that explain the different components of the water cycle such as condensation, precipitation, and evaporation.

:::

* Try to understand the importance of each component in maintaining the equilibrium of the natural water cycle and on the distribution of natural water resources on Earth.
* The water cycle diagram can be downloaded for a visual representation of the natural water cycle.
* If required, use the interactive water cycle diagram in the multimedia section to get better understanding of the topic.

## Climate Change and The Water Cycle
> section: reading2
> format: Reading
> id: reading2
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a reading that explains how climate change affects the water cycle on Earth.

:::

::: column.grow
 * Use the reading, ‘The Water Cycle and Climate Change’ to understand the effects of climate change on the natural water cycle on Earth.
 * Explore using the text, how processes such as evaporation, precipitation, and cloud formation are affected by climate change.
 * Further explore how these changes in turn could exacerbate global warming, leading to increased changes in the Earth’s climate.
