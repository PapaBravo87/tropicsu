 English for Academic Purposes: Note Making and Summary Writing Using Climate Literature

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate English teacher, you can use a climate change related spoken text to help you in teaching note making and summary writing, as part of English for Academic Purposes (EAP).
The lesson involves training students to listen to an academic talk carefully, make notes, and then turn the notes into a summary. This talk titled ‘How to Transform Apocalyptic Fatigue into Action on Global Warming’ by Per Espen Stoknes is about climate change communication.

## Topic introduction and discussion using reading

> duration: 20 min

::: .teaching-notes
Here is a step-by-step guide to using this lesson plan in the classroom/laboratory. We have suggested these steps as a possible plan of action. You may customize the lesson plan according to your preferences and requirements.
The resources suggested are:
 1. A brief introduction of Per Espen Stoknes, the speaker of the TED talk, ‘How to Transform Apocalyptic Fatigue into Action on Global Warming’, which is the primary spoken text used as teaching material for note making and summary writing in this lesson plan.
 2. reading to introduce note making, and how it can be done for a spoken text. 
 3. reading to explain how a summary can be written from notes.
:::

* Begin with the following questions to understand the context and content of the talk to be examined. 
 1. What do you understand by climate change?
 2. What kind of news or stories do you encounter regarding climate change?
 3. As an individual, if you wish to convince someone of your point of view, what strategies do you employ?

* The talk uder discussion pertains to climate change communication, and rhetorical or persuasive strategies in communication will also be discussed.
* Next, use the brief account, [‘Per Espen Stoknes’](https://www.ted.com/speakers/per_espen_stoknes) by TED.com that introduces the speaker whose TED talk, ‘How to Transform Apocalyptic Fatigue into Action on Global Warming’, will be studied for note making and summary writing. Stoknes is a psychologist and an economist, and a member of the Green Party in Norway. He is the author of the book, ‘What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming’ (2015).
* Now, use the resource, [‘Note making’](https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1401/academic_skills/85/note_making/1) by University of Leeds, to introduce your students to the concept of note making. Begin with an explanation of what note making is, and how to do it for a spoken text. Notes are not complete sentences, but key words linked together so that the outline can retrospectively give the note maker a good sense of the entire talk. 

::: column.grow
* To prepare notes from a talk, you will have to listen carefully to the talk being examined; identify key terms, and the order of ideas; and note them in an abbreviated manner.
* Finally, use the tool, [‘How to Write a Summary’](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/englishcomp1v2xmaster/chapter/how-to-write-a-summary/)  by Lumen Learning, that introduces the topic of summary writing. It explains what a summary is- it is a paragraphed text that recapitulates, in one’s own words, the main points and illustrative examples of the original text. You are supposed to capture what the original text says in the summarizer’s own words but without commentary or opinion.

::: column.grow
* The summary should include the title of the talk, the speaker’s name, and the topic, along with the key points, critical arguments, and illustrative examples. It should answer questions such as the what, why, and how of the text. Use the enumerated points in the text to further explain the salient features of a summary and discuss the format in which a summary is written.

## Watch the TED talk and make notes
> section: video
> id: video
> format: Video
> duration: 10 min

::: .teaching-notes
Use a TED talk by Per Espen Stoknes, to analyze using note making skills first, followed by summary writing skills.
The video might be played in 4 parts as suggested below.
:::

* Play the video, ‘How to Transform Apocalyptic Fatigue into Action on Global Warming’ by Per Espen Stoknes, in 4 parts. The reason for breaking this into parts is that each part forms one subsection of the talk, and the talk itself is about 15 minutes long, so for the students to take notes for the entire talk at one go may be overwhelming.
* If you are not very comfortable with the accent of the speaker or with the English language itself, you can slow the speed of the talk using the speed button on the link.
 * Part 1: 00:00 – 02:00 minutes 
 * Part 2: 02:01 – 07:19 minutes 
 * Part 3: 07:20 – 11:25 minutes 
 * Part 4: 11:26 – 15:00 minutes 
* Between each sub-section, take 3-5 minutes to check with the students if they can understand the talk and discuss what they are taking down in the form of notes. It is important to remind them to write down key words as they appear on screen, a few words to help them remember an example, and the primary argument being made in that subsection. If they have not understood a term, you may need to explain it.
* You may also note down these key points. This subsection-wise discussion should help you to fill in the gaps that you might have had from own listening.

## Summary Writing and Classroom Discussion
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> id: activity
> duration: 30-40 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Conduct a classroom activity of summary writing using the notes prepared from listening carefully to the Per Espen Stoknes’ talk mentioned above. This will be followed by a classroom discussion using a set of questions.
* Homework assignment: Ask your students to write short summaries that cover the 4 points mentioned below, using their prepared notes.
:::

* Play the video once more, but this time without any breaks. This will help you fill any gaps that you might have when you watched the video the first time or questions that did not get answered during the discussions. Once done, go over your notes.
* Then revise what a summary is. Now,refer your notes and write a summary of the talk. For this video’s length, the summary will be about 600-700 words. It will be split into four parts (parallel to the breaks above), and therefore, will have a minimum of four paragraphs.

* Have a (classroom) discussion, using the following set of questions. During this, it is encouraged to make notes again.
 1. Why do we need more effective communication skills when it comes to climate change?
 2. What useful strategies does the speaker suggest for effectively communicating about, and engaging with, climate change?

::: column.grow
 3. What is the significance of stories, according to the speaker?
 4. Do you agree with the strategies that Per Espen Stoknes suggests? Do you think these would be successful in other communication contexts?
 5. What does this talk tell us about human beings and their minds?
