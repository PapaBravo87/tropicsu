# Coriolis force

## Overview
> section: overview

As a high school or undergraduate Physics or Earth Sciences teacher, you can use this set of computer-based tools to help you in teaching about Coriolis Force, the Coriolis Effect, and how the Coriolis Effect influences climate (trade winds and upwelling).

This lesson plan allows students to understand the Coriolis Force, and the effect of the Coriolis Force on weather and climate. The videos and activity explain how the Coriolis effect determines the direction of trade winds and upwelling in the oceans.

__Grade Level__: High School, undergraduate  
__Discipline__: Physics, Earth Sciences  
__Topics__: Coriolis Force, Coriolis Effect, Trade Winds, Upwelling  
__Climate Topic__: Climate and the atmosphere, Climate and the hydrosphere  
__Location__: Global  
__Languages__: English  

### Learning Outcomes

The tools in this lesson plan will enable students to:

* Describe the Coriolis effect
* Compare the influence of the Coriolis effect on the direction of motion in the Northern and Southern hemispheres of Earth
* Discuss the influence of the Coriolis effect on the climate of a region.

## Coriolis on a paper map
> section: activity
> id: activity
> format: Classroom activity
> duration: 10-15 min

::: .teaching-notes
Conduct a hands-on activity to help students gain a better understanding of the Coriolis effect. In this activity, students use a simple paper-based model to answer questions and discuss the Coriolis effect.

* [Instructor's notes](/resources/coriolis-force/downloads/instructor_notes_coriolis_effect.pdf).
* [Answer key](/resources/coriolis-force/downloads/answer_key_coriolis_effect.pdf).
* Student's handout is below.

:::

Now you can make a small experiment to see the Coriolis effect by yourself. You need two maps of the Earth, one per each hemisphere, where on each half of the Earth is presented in a circle, with the poles in the centers. 

Make a hole in the center of the map with a pencil, place the map flat on the table and hold the pencil on the hole. Now you can rotate the map to simulate the Earth's rotation.

Work with a neighbor to draw one line on the map with a fixed direction, while the other rotates the paper. You will see the deflection of the path due to the Coriolis effect.

Your teacher will guide you with several questions.

In oceanography, we are most interested in how the Coriolis Effect moves winds and ocean currents on the rotating Earth.

## Upwelling
> section: video2
> format: Video
> duration: 6 min


Watch this video about the idea of Upwelling in the oceans, and how the direction of motion of water is influenced by the Coriolis effect.

Discuss the effect of upwelling on the climate of various regions in the world.

## Trade winds
> section: video3
> format: Video
> duration: 6 min

Watch this video that introduces the topic of trade winds, and how the direction of these winds is influenced by the Coriolis Effect
