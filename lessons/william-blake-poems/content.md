## Comparison of the 2 poems and the impact of the Industrial Revolution on climate
> section: activity
> format: Classroom Activity
> id: activity
> duration: 15 min

::: .teaching-notes
* Part 1: Once both the poems are discussed in detail, ask the students to compare the two poems. Discuss the similarities and differences in the poems. 

Answer Points:
Among the things that are common between the two poems: the character and occupation of the narrator; the notion of exploitation; the contrasts between black and white; unchanged conditions of poverty and labor
Among the things that have changed between the two poems: rhyme scheme; the first poem offers hope in the form of religion and hard work but the second poem offers no hope or escape; stark criticism in the second poem of church, religion, family, and government; the moral lesson of hard work in the first and of no redemption in the second poem.

* Part 2: Climate change discussion- Use the reference to 'soot' and discuss how large-scale coal-burning during the Industrial Revolution may have affected society at large. 
Use the interactive slider 'Cumulative CO2 emissions, 1751' to initiate a discussion on the contribution of England's Industrial Revolution to this emission data.


:::
* Part 1: Try to compare the two poems by Blake. At this point, note that the first poem belongs to a set of poems called "Songs of Innocence" and the second to "Songs of Experience". This is reflected in the change in tones and narratives of the two poems.
Discuss what elements do you find in common and what seems to have changed between the poems.

::: column.grow

* Part 2: Climate change discussion- Use the reference to 'soot' and discuss how large-scale coal-burning during the Industrial Revolution may have affected society at large. This was the beginning of an extensive use of coal for energy by humans. Further, explore that coal-burning resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that have since contributed to global warming, one of the drivers of current climate change.
Use the interactive slider, 'Cumulative CO2 emissions, 1751' to visualize a timeline of country-wise carbon dioxide emissions since the pre-industrial age. 

Use this tool to extend your thinking on the contribution of England's Industrial Revolution to this emission data.
