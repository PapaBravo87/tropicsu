url: https://extension.umaine.edu/signs-of-the-seasons/resources-for-educators/red-maple-leaf-out/

description: A classroom/laboratory activity to explore the possible role of climate-related environmental factors in the timing of leaf-out in plants (specifically, red maple leaf-out in New England).

learningOutcomes: |
  In this activity, students will create graphs by using data for the timing of red maple leaf-out in New England. They will analyze these graphs and discuss the possible effect of changing spring temperatures on leaf-out.

    Use this tool to help students find answers to:

    1. What is leaf-out?
    2. What are the climate-related factors that may affect leaf-out in plants?
    3. Which phenological events in plants could be affected by a change in the average spring temperature?
