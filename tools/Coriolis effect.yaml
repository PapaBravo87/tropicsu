description: A hands-on classroom/laboratory activity to learn about the Coriolis Effect.

learningOutcomes: |
    In this activity, students use a simple paper-based model to understand how the Coriolis Effect influences the direction of winds, currents, and other objects in the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

    Use this tool to help students find answers to:

    1. What is the Coriolis Effect?
    2. How does the Coriolis Effect affect the direction of motion in the Northern Hemisphere?
    3. How does the Coriolis Effect affect the direction of motion in the Southern Hemisphere?
