description: A classroom/laboratory activity to establish the potential link between the geographic distribution of malaria and increasing temperature caused by climate change.  

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will use maps and temperature data sheets to determine the locations where malaria is known to occur and the temperature ranges in these locations. Further, they will discuss and explore the potential impact of climate change and the resulting change in temperature on the geographic distribution of malaria.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. What are the factors that influence the distribution and spread of malaria?
    2. How could a change in the average global temperature affect the geographic distribution of malaria?
