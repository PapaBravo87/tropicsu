description: A model/simulator to learn about and use the Kaya Identity to predict future carbon emissions.

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will customize parameters such as changes in population, GDP per capita, energy intensity, and carbon intensity of energy sources to observe the modelâ€™s predictions on future carbon emissions.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. Determine the amount of carbon emissions and the change in global surface temperature if the population of the Earth is doubled.
    2. Determine the amount of carbon emissions and the change in global surface temperature if the rate of change of the GDP per capita is 2% per year.
