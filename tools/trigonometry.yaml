description: A classroom/laboratory activity to model temperature data by using trigonometric functions.


learningOutcomes: |
  Students will model given temperature data (for Wellington, New Zealand) by using sine and cosine functions. 
  They will compare models and discuss their observations. 
  This activity can be replicated for any location for which temperature data is available.

  Use this tool to help students find answers to:

  1. Write trigonometric equations to model the given temperature data.
  2. In which scenarios would the sine function be a more suitable model for temperature data? 
  3. In which scenarios would the cosine function be a more suitable model for temperature data?
