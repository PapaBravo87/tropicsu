title: Effect of Changes in Radiation on Planetary Temperature
url: http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/fsmqs/level-3-algebra#Climate%20prediction

description: A classroom/laboratory activity to model how changes in the radiation entering or leaving the Earth affect the temperature of the planet.

learningOutcomes: |
  Students will model the data by using Excel spreadsheets and will then determine whether a polynomial function or an exponential function provides the best prediction.

  Use this tool to help students find answers to:

  1. How does the Earthâ€™s temperature change for a 10% increase in radiation input?
  2. Compare different functions (quadratic, cubic, quartic, exponential) to model the data (temperature vs time). 
  3. Which function provides the best prediction?
