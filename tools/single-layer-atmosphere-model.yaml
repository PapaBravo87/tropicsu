url: https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/atmosphericwarming/singlelayermodel.html

description: A reading that introduces a single-layer atmosphere model, which is based on the emissivity of thermal radiation, to explain atmospheric warming. 


learningOutcomes: |
  Students will learn about the absorptivity and emissivity of grey bodies, the equation for planetary energy balance, and emission profiles of different sources while understanding a simple model to determine planetary surface temperatures.

    Use this tool to help students find answers to:
    1. Define emissivity and absorptivity.
    2. Describe the single-layer atmosphere model for atmospheric warming.
