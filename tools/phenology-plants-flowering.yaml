description: A classroom/laboratory activity to learn about phenology and phenological events, and to understand the potential impacts of climate change on periodic life-cycle events in plants, specifically, on the bloom date of North American lilac shrubs.

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will use phenology data on flowering patterns to create graphs, and will then interpret and discuss their findings.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. Name some phenological events in plants and animals.
    2. What are the possible impacts of climate change on the flowering of plants?
