description: A classroom/laboratory activity or teaching module to perform cost-benefit analysis for carbon emissions abatement, considered to be an action that will mitigate climate change.

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will learn about cost-benefit analysis, and will determine the costs and benefits of abating carbon emissions. They will also learn about the development of efficient emissions targets.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:
