description: A reading to learn about what affect hurricane activity and the
  measures that can help in building resilience to the impacts of hurricanes.

learningOutcomes: |
  Students will read about the effects of warmer sea surface temperatures and
  sea-level rise on hurricanes. They will also discuss changes in the frequency
  and intensity of hurricanes in recent decades, the damage caused by hurricanes,
  and actions for a community to adapt to and build resilience to hurricane-related threats.

  Use this tool to help students find answers to:

  1. How might warmer sea surface temperatures and rise in sea levels affect hurricane intensity?
  2. How do hurricanes affect coastal areas? What measures could be taken to decrease this impact?
