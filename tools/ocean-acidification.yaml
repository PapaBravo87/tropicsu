description: A video to understand ocean acidification and its impacts.

learningOutcomes: |
  Students will learn about how carbon dioxide (CO2) affects the pH of the ocean, and how increasing ocean acidity may adversely affect marine life and the seafood industry.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. How might increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere change the pH of the ocean
    2. What are the possible impacts of ocean acidification on marine life?
