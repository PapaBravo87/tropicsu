    Students will run a simulation to explore how an increase in fossil fuel use will affect the natural carbon cycle, and will discuss the possible impacts on flora and fauna.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. Which components in the carbon cycle act as carbon sinks?
    2. What are the possible impacts of deforestation on the natural carbon cycle? How might these changes affect the Earthâ€™s climate?
