title: Atmospheric dynamics and Hadley cells
url: https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/hadley.html

description: A reading to learn about the Hadley Cell and a simple model for the Hadley Circulation, using the law of conservation of angular momentum.

learningOutcomes: |
    In this reading, students will discuss and explore the effects of changes in atmospheric dynamics on Hadley circulation and will analyze the potential impacts on climate. Students will also learn to derive atmospheric dynamics equations for a model of Hadley circulation (based on Farrell’s theory).

    Use this tool to help students find answers to:

    1. What are Hadley Cells?
    2. According to Farrell’s theory, what factors determine the extent of Hadley cells?
    3. What could be the resulting effects on climate?
