description: An audio podcast (Prof. Bathsheba Demuth interviewed by Prof. Dagomar Degroot) to learn about environmental and climate-related changes in the Arctic, the history of capitalism and communism across the Bering Strait, and the unique ecological characteristics and economic ideologies in the Arctic that would be of interest to environmental historians.

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will learn about climate-related changes in the Arctic—such as higher temperatures in the summer, changing snowfall patterns, shift in caribou migration patterns—and the possible consequences for the indigenous communities living in the region.  They will also understand the differences in the economic ideologies between the Arctic and temperate regions.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. How is the study of the Arctic different from a study of the temperate regions in the context of climate change and economic ideologies?
    2. How has climate change altered the landscape in the Yukon?
    3. How did the harnessing of energy change in the Arctic when the economy changed from a subsistence-based one to one that focused on surplus production?
