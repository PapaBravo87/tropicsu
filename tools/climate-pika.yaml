description: A video that explains the impact of climate change on the habitat and population of a species (specifically, the American Pika) and explores whether this species could be used as an indicator of climate change.

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will learn about climate-related factors that are important for the survival of pikas in summer and winter. They will also understand how climate-sensitive species such as alpine pikas could serve as indicators of the health of water resources in alpine ecosystems, Use this tool to help students find answers to:

    1. How could climate change affect the survival of the American Pika?
    2. How is the effect of climate change on the American Pika being studied?
