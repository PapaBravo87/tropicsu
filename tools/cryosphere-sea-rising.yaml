title: Cryosphere and rising sea levels
url: https://serc.carleton.edu/eslabs/cryosphere/6b.html

description: A classroom/laboratory activity that introduces the relationship between climate and the cryosphere, explains how sea-level rise can be predicted (based on average global temperature change), and triggers a discussion on the potential impacts of sea-level rise. 

learningOutcomes: |
    In this activity, students will examine actual data for projected sea-level rise, and will use a visualization to view the possible impacts of sea level rise and storm surges on different locations in the continental U.S.

    Use this tool to help students find answers to:

    1. Name the largest glaciers (in terms of volume) in the world.
    2. What would be the impact of the melting of large glaciers on coastal locations across the world?
