description: A classroom/laboratory activity to examine and analyze squirrel species distribution and habitat data (from the USA) over time, and to interpret the possible relationship between climate change and changes in biodiversity.

learningOutcomes: |
    Students will analyze data for past and modern squirrel populations and habitats, and will then interpret and discuss their findings.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. Describe the habitats for different squirrel species.
    2. How has climate change affected squirrel species distribution over time?
