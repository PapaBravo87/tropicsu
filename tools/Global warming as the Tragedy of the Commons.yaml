    Students will examine past environmental problems to understand the concept of the tragedy of the commons. Then, they will discuss “Earth’s atmosphere” as a commons and “global warming” as a tragedy, and propose economic solutions to solve this tragedy-of-the-commons problem.

    Use this tool to help your students find answers to:

    1. Describe the concept of tragedy of the commons.
    2. Discuss global warming (caused by climate change) as a tragedy-of-the-commons problem.
    3. Propose two fiscal policies that could be solutions to the global warming problem.
