          p #[strong Climate change] is considered to be the most critical factor affecting sustainable and equitable development, increasing conflicts, and causing massive extinction of species. Its impact is inseparable from our day-to-day life, now and in future, so is both a problem to be addressed by action policies, and a problem that requires education and that can be adopted for more effective teaching.
          //Educational methods are more effective when students are challenged to identify the cause and effect of a problem that they can relate to their life.

          p The #[strong TROP ICSU project] collects and curates educational resources for teachers and self-learners to learn about Climate Change.  The quality of life of future generations is largely dependent on the quality of education that we impart to todayâ€™s students.

    p The goal is not to introduce Climate Education as a stand-alone topic, but to integrate it with the core curriculum of Science, Mathematics, and Social Sciences.
